            <h2>The Prison Wrapped in Paradise</h2>
            <p>Alone, adrift upon the endless sea, Odysseus clung to the wreckage of his ship—his men lost, his hope fading with each rising sun. Carried by relentless currents, he drifted for days until the sea surrendered him to an island unlike any other: Ogygia, a place untouched by time, where nature bloomed with eternal spring.</p>
            <p>This was the domain of Calypso, the nymph whose beauty rivaled the dawn. She found Odysseus washed ashore, broken in body but unyielding in spirit. With tenderness, she nursed him back to health, her voice as soft as the waves, her touch like the warmth of the sun.</p>
            <p>Calypso offered him more than shelter. She offered immortality—a life free from pain, wrapped in eternal youth, with her by his side as a goddess’ consort.</p>
            <p>But Odysseus’ heart was bound to Ithaca. Despite the paradise before him, he sat each day on the shore, staring westward, where his home lay beyond sight, beyond reach. His heart beat not for eternal life, but for the mortal bonds of family, memory, and love.</p>

            <h2>When Even Gods Cannot Cage the Heart</h2>
            <p>Years passed. For seven long years, Odysseus remained on Ogygia—a prisoner not by chains, but by the weight of his grief and Calypso’s enchantment. Yet his heart never surrendered.</p>
            <p>Far above, on Mount Olympus, the gods watched. Athena, ever his protector, could no longer bear to see her favored mortal trapped by fate’s cruelty. She spoke before Zeus:</p>
            <p>“Father of gods and men, will you let Odysseus suffer endlessly while his heart beats only for home? It is not right for a man so tested to be denied his journey.”</p>
            <p>Zeus agreed. He sent Hermes, the swift messenger, to deliver his decree to Calypso:</p>
            <p>"Release him. His fate lies elsewhere."</p>
            <p>Calypso’s heart burned with sorrow and fury. “You gods envy even the love of a goddess,” she spat at Hermes. But divine will cannot be defied.</p>
            <p>With heavy grace, she approached Odysseus and spoke the words he had longed to hear:</p>
            <p>“I will not keep you. Build your raft, and the sea will carry you home. But know this—I offered you eternity, and you choose sorrow.”</p>

        <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
            <h2>The Man Who Chose Mortality</h2>
            <p>Odysseus built his raft with Calypso’s help, though her eyes betrayed a sorrow deeper than the sea itself. As he set sail, she stood upon the shore, her immortal heart bound to a man destined to fade like all mortals.</p>
            <p>For days, Odysseus sailed under open skies, the taste of freedom sweet upon the wind. But the gods were not done with him.</p>
            <p>Poseidon, still nursing his ancient grudge, saw Odysseus upon the waves.</p>
            <p>“So, the gods have freed you?” he roared, summoning storms with the fury of a god scorned. “Let me see how far you sail now, son of Laertes.”</p>
            <p>The skies darkened. The sea rose. Odysseus’ raft shattered beneath the wrath of the Earth-Shaker.</p>
            <p>Cast once more into the abyss, he fought not against gods, but against the sea itself—his will the only thing keeping him afloat.</p>
