            <h2>Setup – The Call to Battle</h2>
            <p><strong>The Shores of Troy</strong></p>
            <p>The Greek fleet arrived like a dark tide—a thousand ships, their sails swollen with the winds bought by Iphigenia’s sacrifice. The coastline of Troy stretched before them, golden sands soon to be stained with blood.</p>
            <p>As the Greeks disembarked, Agamemnon, high king of Mycenae, claimed command. But among the countless warriors, none shone brighter than Achilles, the young demigod whose wrath would shape the destiny of men. His armor gleamed like fire under the sun, and beside him stood his closest companion, Patroclus, whose fate was tied to his own.</p>
            <p>From the towering walls of Troy, King Priam watched with weary eyes, knowing the war had come to his doorstep. His sons—Hector, the noble defender, and Paris, whose choices had ignited the conflict—stood ready, though the gods had already written their fates in the stars.</p>

            <h2>Conflict & Action – The Clash of Titans</h2>
            <p><strong>The War That Would Not End</strong></p>
            <p>The siege began with the fury of men who believed in swift victory—but Troy was no ordinary city. Its walls, said to be built by the gods themselves, stood unyielding.</p>
            <p>The Greeks raided the Trojan countryside, burning villages, taking spoils, and enslaving captives. Yet despite their strength, the city remained untaken, its gates closed under Hector’s vigilant watch.</p>
            <p>As months turned to years, the war became a brutal cycle of battle and bloodshed. Heroes rose and fell—each seeking <em>kleos</em>, eternal glory etched into memory through acts of valor.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ajax the Great</strong>, a towering figure of brute strength, fought with a shield large enough to cover two men.</li>
                <li><strong>Diomedes</strong>, fierce and relentless, dared even to wound gods in battle.</li>
                <li><strong>Odysseus</strong>, ever cunning, wove strategies that saved Greek lives when strength alone failed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But pride, more than spears or swords, became the war’s most dangerous weapon.</p>
            <p>A quarrel erupted between Agamemnon and Achilles over a captive woman, Briseis, claimed as a prize of war. Agamemnon’s arrogance clashed with Achilles’ pride, and in his fury, Achilles withdrew from battle, refusing to fight under Agamemnon’s command.</p>
            <p>Without Achilles, the Greeks faltered.</p>

            <h2>Resolution & Cliffhanger – The Cost of Pride</h2>
            <p><strong>The Battle Without Achilles</strong></p>
            <p>With Achilles absent, the Trojans surged. Hector, embodying both honor and duty, led his forces beyond the city’s walls, driving the Greeks back toward the sea. The tide of war had turned.</p>
            <p>Greek heroes fell, their cries swallowed by the roar of battle. The very ships that had carried them to Troy burned as Trojan torches met Greek sails.</p>
            <p>But pride would demand a price.</p>
            <p>In the heart of the Greek camp, Patroclus—aching to save his comrades—donned Achilles’ armor, hoping to inspire fear in the Trojans and hope in the Greeks. The deception worked—until he faced Hector.</p>
            <p>Blades met. Fate decided.</p>
            <p>Patroclus fell, slain by Hector’s spear.</p>
            <p>His death would awaken a rage in Achilles far greater than any wounded pride. Not even the gods would be able to contain what came next.</p>
