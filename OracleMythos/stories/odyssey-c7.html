            <h2>The Shores of the Dead</h2>
            <p>With Circe’s guidance echoing in his mind, Odysseus and his men set sail once more—not toward home, but into the unknown. Their ship cut through black waters, leaving the warmth of the living world behind as mist thickened and the sky grew heavy with silence.</p>
            <p>They reached the land where the sun never touches, a desolate shore bathed in eternal twilight. Here, at the edge of the world, Odysseus prepared to cross the threshold no mortal should—into the realm of Hades.</p>
            <p>Following Circe’s instructions, he dug a trench and poured libations: milk and honey, sweet wine, water, and a final sprinkle of barley. He offered blood, the key that summoned the dead. As it darkened the earth, shadows rose—spirits drawn to the warmth of life they could no longer touch.</p>
            <p>But Odysseus stood firm. He had come for one voice among countless whispers: Tiresias, the blind prophet who held the key to his fate.</p>

        <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
            <h2>Prophecies and Ghosts</h2>
            <p>The dead gathered, their faces pale echoes of who they once were—warriors, kings, and forgotten souls alike. Odysseus fought back fear as he kept them at bay with his sword, allowing only Tiresias to drink from the sacrificial blood.</p>
            <p>Tiresias’ hollow eyes opened, seeing more in death than mortals ever could in life.</p>
            <p>“Odysseus,” the shade intoned, “you seek your home, but your path is cursed. Poseidon’s wrath follows you across the waves. Beware the island of Helios—touch not his sacred cattle, or ruin shall find you. Even if you survive, you will return alone, to a house of suitors devouring your kingdom.”</p>
            <p>Odysseus listened, his heart heavy with the weight of a future shaped by gods and his own choices.</p>
            <p>But Tiresias was not the only ghost with words to share. The spirit of Anticlea, Odysseus’ mother, appeared, her form fragile as mist. She spoke of Ithaca’s decay, of Penelope’s loyalty, and of Telemachus, grown but lost without his father.</p>
            <p>Odysseus wept, unable to embrace her, his arms passing through her like smoke.</p>
            <p>Then came the shades of fallen comrades—Agamemnon, bitter with tales of betrayal; Achilles, restless even in death, lamenting the hollow glory of war.</p>
            <p>Each voice carved new scars into Odysseus’ soul.</p>

        <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
            <h2>The Price of Knowledge</h2>
            <p>The spirits grew restless, hungering for the blood, their whispers turning to wails. Fear surged in Odysseus’ heart—not the fear of death, but of forgetting the warmth of life.</p>
            <p>“Enough!” he roared, staggering back as the dead reached for him, their hollow eyes filled with longing.</p>
            <p>He fled to his ship, the voices of the underworld chasing him like a tide. As the oars sliced through dark waters, the land of the dead faded into shadow, but its echoes remained etched in his heart.</p>
            <p>Odysseus had gained knowledge—but at a cost.</p>
            <p>Ahead, the sea stretched wide, hiding monsters that no prophecy could fully prepare him for. The Sirens’ song waited beyond the horizon, and with it, the next trial of his cursed voyage.</p>
