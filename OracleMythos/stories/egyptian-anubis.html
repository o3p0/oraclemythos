    <h2>Full Story</h2>
    <p>
      Anubis, one of the most recognizable gods of ancient Egypt, is the jackal-headed deity associated with mummification and the protection of the dead. As the guardian of tombs, Anubis ensures the safe passage of souls into the afterlife, guiding them through the treacherous journey of the Duat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anubis's role extends to the weighing of the heart ceremony, a critical step in determining whether a soul is worthy of entering the Field of Reeds. Using the scales of Ma'at, Anubis weighs the heart of the deceased against the feather of truth. If the heart is lighter than the feather, the soul is deemed pure and allowed to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Known for his wisdom and unwavering dedication, Anubis symbolizes protection, justice, and the sacred rituals of death. His image remains a lasting representation of the ancient Egyptians' profound respect for the afterlife and the divine order.
