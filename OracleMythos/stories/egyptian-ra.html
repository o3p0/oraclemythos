      <p>
        Ra, the powerful sun god of Egyptian mythology, is revered as the bringer of life, light, and order to the cosmos. Each day, he embarks on his celestial journey across the sky in his solar barque, illuminating the world and sustaining all life.

      <p>
        As night falls, Ra’s journey takes him into Duat, the underworld. Here, he faces the mighty serpent Apophis, the embodiment of chaos, who seeks to devour the sun and engulf the world in eternal darkness. With the help of other gods, such as Set and Ma’at, Ra wages an epic battle against Apophis, ensuring the cycle of day and night remains unbroken.

      <h3 class="section-title">The Cycle of Life, Death, and Rebirth</h3>
      <img src="/images/stories/ra-cycle.jpg" alt="Ra's cycle of rebirth" class="story-image">
      <p>
        Ra’s journey represents the Egyptian ideals of renewal and the balance between order (Ma’at) and chaos. His daily voyage through the sky and nightly passage through the underworld mirrors the cycles of life, death, and rebirth, which were central to Egyptian beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This cyclical journey assures that light will always triumph over darkness, providing a timeless testament to resilience and divine power.
