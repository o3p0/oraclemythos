    <h2>Full Story</h2>
    <p>
      Tezcatlipoca, one of the most powerful deities in Aztec mythology, is known as the "Smoking Mirror" due to his association with obsidian mirrors used in divination. Representing destiny, discord, and the darker aspects of life, he embodies the duality of creation and destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tezcatlipoca is often depicted as a rival to Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent. In one legend, the two gods cooperated to create the world but later clashed over its direction. Tezcatlipoca's cunning led to Quetzalcoatl's downfall and eventual exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a god of chaos and power, Tezcatlipoca was feared and revered. He was believed to bring both prosperity and calamity, testing humanity's resilience and faith. His influence extends to themes of fate and inevitability, reminding the Aztecs of the transient nature of existence.
