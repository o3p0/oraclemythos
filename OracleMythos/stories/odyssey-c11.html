            <h2>Washed Ashore, Stripped of All but His Name</h2>
            <p>Battered by Poseidon’s fury, Odysseus clung to driftwood—the shattered remains of his raft—fighting against waves that seemed determined to drag him into the abyss. His body was broken, but his will remained unyielding.</p>
            <p>After days adrift, the sea finally relented, casting him upon the shores of Scheria, the land of the Phaeacians, a people favored by the gods, known for their seafaring prowess and unmatched hospitality.</p>
            <p>Exhausted and naked, Odysseus collapsed beneath the shade of olive trees, his identity hidden beneath layers of salt, scars, and silence.</p>
            <p>But fate stirred. On that very day, Nausicaa, daughter of King Alcinous, came to the river with her handmaidens to wash linen. They laughed, their voices dancing on the breeze—until they discovered the stranger, wild-eyed and desperate, rising from the reeds like a ghost.</p>
            <p>Odysseus, ever the master of words, approached not with pride, but with humility. He knelt before Nausicaa, covering his modesty with a broken branch, and spoke with eloquence forged through suffering.</p>
            <p>"Pity me, princess. I am a man battered by the gods, a wanderer with no home. Grant me kindness, and may the gods bless you for your grace."</p>
            <p>Moved by his words and noble bearing, Nausicaa offered him aid, commanding her maids to clothe and feed the stranger.</p>
            <p>But she kept one thing clear: "Do not follow me directly to the palace. Walk behind us through the city. My people are swift to judge, and rumors cling like ivy."</p>

        <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
            <h2>The Hidden Hero Among Hosts</h2>
            <p>Guided by Nausicaa’s instructions, Odysseus approached the grand palace of King Alcinous, its walls shining with bronze, its gardens blooming with eternal spring—a place where the divine and mortal worlds brushed against each other.</p>
            <p>Inside, he found Alcinous and Queen Arete seated like gods among mortals. As custom demanded, Odysseus threw himself at Arete’s feet, grasping her knees—a gesture of supplication.</p>
            <p>"Queen, grant me your mercy. I have suffered greatly, far from my homeland. I seek only the kindness of your hearth and the hope of returning home."</p>
            <p>The court fell silent, the stranger’s presence as striking as his words. Alcinous, moved by the sacred law of <em>xenia</em> (hospitality), welcomed him warmly.</p>
            <p>"You shall have food, rest, and when the time comes, a ship to carry you home."</p>
            <p>But Odysseus kept his name hidden, wearing anonymity like armor. It wasn’t until the next day, during a grand feast where songs of Troy’s fall echoed through the hall, that his heart broke open.</p>
            <p>The bard sang of Achilles and Hector, of heroes lost to time. Odysseus wept, his tears betraying the truth his words had concealed.</p>
            <p>Alcinous saw this and spoke: "Stranger, your sorrow speaks louder than your silence. Tell us your name, your story. Let us know the man behind the tears."</p>
        </section>

        <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
            <h2>Odysseus Revealed</h2>
            <p>Odysseus rose, no longer able to hide behind humility or mystery. His voice, steady but shadowed with grief, filled the hall:</p>
            <p>"I am Odysseus, son of Laertes, king of Ithaca. I am the man of many wiles, cursed and blessed by the gods, lost to the sea, yet never broken."</p>
            <p>The Phaeacian court listened in awe as he began to weave the tale of his long, harrowing journey—the fall of Troy, the Cyclops’ cave, Circe’s island, the journey to the Underworld, the Sirens, Scylla and Charybdis, and the loss of his crew.</p>
            <p>His words painted images of gods and monsters, of love and betrayal, of hope flickering in the darkest places. But beneath the epic tales was a man stripped bare by suffering, yearning only for the simple grace of home.</p>
            <p>As he spoke, Alcinous made a vow: "When your story is done, you shall not wander further. We will sail you home, across Poseidon’s waters, to the shores of Ithaca."</p>

            <p>But the gods were not finished with Odysseus.</p>
