    <h2>Full Story</h2>
    <p>
      Quetzalcoatl, known as the Feathered Serpent, is one of the most revered deities in Aztec mythology. A god of wind, air, and learning, Quetzalcoatl represents wisdom, creation, and the guiding force behind humanity's progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Aztec legends, Quetzalcoatl played a pivotal role in the creation of humanity. He descended into the underworld, Mictlan, to recover the bones of the previous generations. After facing numerous trials and deceits by the underworld gods, he successfully retrieved the bones and used them to create the humans of the Fifth Sun, the current age of the world.

      Quetzalcoatl is also credited with teaching civilization to the Aztecs. He introduced agriculture, the calendar, and writing, emphasizing the importance of learning and harmony. Though he was eventually driven away from his people, his promise to return left a lasting impact on Aztec culture.
