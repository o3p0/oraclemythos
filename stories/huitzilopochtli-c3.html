      <h2>Setup â€“ The War Begins</h2>
      <p><strong>A Sky Filled with Enemies</strong></p>
      <p>The heavens trembled.</p>
      <p>Coyolxauhqui, the golden-belled warrior, had fallenâ€”her body shattered, her severed head cast into the sky to glow as the pale moon.</p>
      <p>But the battle was not yet won.</p>
      <p>The 400 brothers, the Centzon Huitznahua, the spirits of the night sky, looked upon their fallen sister and howled with rage.</p>
      <p>"He has slain our leader!" they roared. "Kill him! Kill the traitor!"</p>
      <p>Blades of obsidian glistened in the starlight.</p>
      <p>They rushed forward, their war cries shaking the heavens.</p>
      <p>But Huitzilopochtli did not waver.</p>
      <p>He stood at the peak of Coatepec, the Serpent Mountain, his fire-serpent weapon Xiuhcoatl coiled in his hands.</p>
      <p>ðŸ”¥ "Come then," he called. "Face the Sun." ðŸ”¥</p>

      <h2>Conflict â€“ The Sun vs. The Stars</h2>
      <p><strong>The Wrath of Huitzilopochtli</strong></p>
      <p>The stars attacked first, swarming like a storm of shadows.</p>
      <p>Each warrior as bright as a flame, as sharp as a blade.</p>
      <p>They came from all sidesâ€”swords raised, arrows flying, voices crying for vengeance.</p>
      <p>Huitzilopochtli moved like fire itself.</p>
      <p>He was not one warriorâ€”he was many.</p>
      <p>ðŸ”¥ His serpent Xiuhcoatl struck like lightning, turning the stars to ash.</p>
      <p>ðŸ”¥ His feet danced like the wind, untouchable, unstoppable.</p>
      <p>ðŸ”¥ His voice boomed like thunder, shaking the very bones of the mountain.</p>
      <p>One by one, the stars fell.</p>
      <p>The sky, once filled with their blazing light, grew darker and darker.</p>
      <p>They could not overcome him.</p>
      <p>They could not stop the Sun from rising.</p>

      <h2>Resolution â€“ The Birth of Night & Day</h2>
      <p><strong>The Stars Fall, But the War Never Ends</strong></p>
      <p>The last of the 400 stars collapsed, their flames extinguished, their weapons broken.</p>
      <p>Huitzilopochtli stood victorious, his fire unchallenged.</p>
      <p>The sky grew silent.</p>
      <p>The sun had won its first battle.</p>
      <p>But as Huitzilopochtli looked upon the heavens, he saw the scattered remains of the starsâ€”</p>
      <p>They were not gone.</p>
      <p>They still twinkled in the darkness, waiting.</p>
      <p>And he understood.</p>
      <p>The stars would return, every night, to challenge him again.</p>
      <p>The moon, his fallen sister, would rise again and again, seeking revenge.</p>
      <p>The battle would never truly end.</p>
      <p>But neither would the Sun.</p>
      <p>ðŸ”¥ Every morning, he would rise.</p>
      <p>ðŸ”¥ Every evening, they would fall.</p>
      <p>ðŸ”¥ And so, the war would continue until the end of time.</p>
