      <h2>Setup – Sango’s Power Grows, But So Does His Rage</h2>
      <p><strong>Chapter 3: The Wrath of a King 🔥</strong></p>
  
      <p>The city of Oyo trembled beneath a sky streaked with fire. Sango, now imbued with the gift of lightning, stood at the heart of his palace, his fingers tingling with power. His presence had changed—his eyes burned like embers, and when he spoke, his voice carried the weight of the storm.</p>
  
      <p>His people worshipped him, but they also feared him. Where once he was a king of charisma and charm, now he ruled with intensity, his temper quick as a spark in dry grass.</p>
  
      <p>That day, a dispute erupted in the palace. Two warriors, rivals for Sango’s favor, clashed over an accusation of betrayal. The king stood between them, his patience thin as the air before a storm.</p>
  
      <p>“You insult me with your quarrels,” Sango’s voice rumbled. “Shall I let the heavens decide who is right?”</p>
  
      <p>His hand rose, calling forth the storm. Thunder rolled in the distance.</p>
  
      <p>The warriors fell to their knees, pleading. But it was too late.</p>
  
      <p>A crack of lightning split the sky—and in an instant, one warrior lay lifeless, smoke rising from his body.</p>
  
      <p>The crowd gasped. Sango had done the unthinkable.</p>

      <h2>Conflict & Action – The Consequences of Divine Power</h2>
      <p><strong>The Consequences of Divine Power</strong></p>
  
      <p>In the days that followed, whispers spread through Oyo.</p>
  
      <p>“Our king is no longer a man—he is something more.”</p>
  
      <p>Some called him a god on earth. Others murmured of a curse.</p>
  
      <p>Even Sango’s most trusted warriors grew wary. One by one, they lowered their heads in his presence, their hands tightening around their weapons.</p>
  
      <p>His wife, Oya, fierce and wise, saw the change before anyone else. One night, as storm clouds gathered above the palace, she stood before him.</p>
  
      <p>“You carry fire in your hands,” she said, “but fire does not choose what it burns.”</p>
  
      <p>Sango turned to her, lightning dancing in his palms. “I was chosen by the heavens, Oya. The people must understand.”</p>
  
      <p>“And if they fear you?” she asked.</p>
  
      <p>Sango’s fists clenched. Fear was respect. Fear was power.</p>
  
      <p>But even as he spoke, something inside him twisted. A memory—the old priest’s warning. “Fire is a gift, but it is also a burden.”</p>

      <h2>Resolution & Cliffhanger – A Kingdom on the Edge</h2>
      <p><strong>A Kingdom on the Edge</strong></p>
  
      <p>One evening, a council of chiefs gathered in secret.</p>
  
      <p>“This is not the king we swore to follow,” one said.<br>
      “He was once a leader of wisdom, now he rules with fire,” another added.</p>
  
      <p>And so, a plan took shape.</p>
  
      <p>That night, Oyo’s elders sent word to Sango’s rival, Ajaka, his exiled brother.</p>
  
      <p>“Return, and restore balance. The people will not stand against Sango… but they will stand behind you.”</p>
  
      <p>Far away, in the shadows of exile, Ajaka received the message. His eyes darkened. He had waited long for this moment.</p>
  
      <p>The storm of war was coming.</p>
