      <h2>The First Humans‚Äô Divine Gift</h2>
      <p><strong>The Maize People Flourish</strong></p>
  
      <p>The gods looked upon their creation‚Äîthe first true humans.</p>
  
      <p>üåì Jaguar Quitze<br>
      üåë Jaguar Night<br>
      ‚òÄÔ∏è Not Right Now<br>
      üî• Dark Jaguar</p>
  
      <p>They were strong, wise, and grateful. Unlike the Mud People, they would not crumble. Unlike the Wooden People, they would not forget the gods.</p>
  
      <p>The Maize People understood the world.</p>
  
      <p>They saw the stars and knew their movements.<br>
      They looked across mountains and valleys as if distance meant nothing.<br>
      They spoke the names of the gods with reverence and devotion.</p>
  
      <p>The gods were pleased.</p>
  
      <p>As a final blessing, they placed before them the sacred food‚Äîmaize.</p>
  
      <p>"This is your flesh," the gods declared.<br>
      "This is your blood. Cherish it, for it will sustain you, as you will sustain us."</p>
  
      <p>And so, maize became the heart of humanity, the bond between gods and people.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>The Fear of Divine Power</h2>
      <p><strong>The Humans See Too Much</strong></p>
  
      <p>The Maize People were grateful, but they were also powerful.</p>
  
      <p>They saw beyond the horizon.<br>
      They knew what was, what is, and what will be.<br>
      They spoke not just as mortals, but as those who touched the divine.</p>
  
      <p>The gods grew uneasy.</p>
  
      <p>"They see as we do," murmured Heart of Sky.<br>
      "They know too much," said Sovereign Plumed Serpent.<br>
      "If they remain this way, they will become as gods."</p>
  
      <p>The gods had sought devotion, not rivals.</p>
  
      <p>If humans were too powerful, they would no longer need the gods.</p>
  
      <p>This could not be.</p>
  
      <p>So the gods acted‚Äînot in anger, but in balance.</p>

    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>The Clouding of Human Vision</h2>
      <p><strong>A Humbling Gift</strong></p>
  
      <p>The gods approached the humans.</p>
  
      <p>They did not strike them down.<br>
      They did not destroy them, as they had done before.</p>
  
      <p>Instead, they gently touched their eyes.</p>
  
      <p>And in that moment, their vision changed.</p>
  
      <p>They could still see, still understand, still build.</p>
  
      <p>But they would no longer see all things.</p>
  
      <p>They would know the world, but not the heavens.<br>
      They would see time pass, but not the future.</p>
  
      <p>They would remain wise‚Äîbut mortal.</p>
  
      <p>The gods stepped back, watching.</p>
  
      <p>The humans bowed, not in defiance, but in understanding.</p>
  
      <p>"We see what is meant for us," they said.</p>
  
      <p>And the gods knew they had finally succeeded.</p>
  
      <p>The first true humans had been made.</p>
  
      <p>They were not gods.<br>
      They were not weak.<br>
      They were balanced.</p>
  
      <p>And with maize in their hands and the breath of the gods in their souls, the Maya people walked into the world.</p>
