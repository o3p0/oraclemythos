      <h2>Setup ‚Äì The Gods' Second Attempt</h2>
      <p><strong>Strength Without Soul</strong></p>
  
      <p>The Mud People had failed.</p>
  
      <p>They were too fragile, too silent, too empty.</p>
  
      <p>The gods‚ÄîHeart of Sky (Huracan) and Sovereign Plumed Serpent‚Äîstood over the earth, their first creation crumbled into dust.</p>
  
      <p>"We must try again," said Sovereign Plumed Serpent. "We need something stronger."</p>
  
      <p>"Let them be firm as the trees," Heart of Sky commanded. "Let them stand tall and unyielding."</p>
  
      <p>So the gods reached out and took the wood of the world, the strong, unbending trees.</p>
  
      <p>They shaped new humans‚Äîtall, straight-backed, with limbs that would not break.</p>
  
      <p>They breathed life into them.</p>
  
      <p>And for the first time, humans walked the earth.</p>
  
      <p>But something was missing.</p>

      <h2>Conflict ‚Äì The Flaw of the Wooden People</h2>
      <p><strong>Hollow and Heartless</strong></p>
  
      <p>The Wooden People spoke.</p>
  
      <p>They moved with strength.</p>
  
      <p>They worked without faltering.</p>
  
      <p>But they did not laugh.</p>
  
      <p>They did not cry.</p>
  
      <p>They did not love.</p>
  
      <p>The gods watched in disappointment.</p>
  
      <p>"They are strong," Heart of Sky admitted. "But they have no souls."</p>
  
      <p>"They do not praise us," Sovereign Plumed Serpent said, his voice heavy with regret. "They do not remember the gods."</p>
  
      <p>The Wooden People had no gratitude, no spirit.</p>
  
      <p>They built homes but felt no warmth within them.<br>
      They raised families but knew no love for one another.<br>
      They lived without purpose, without reverence, without devotion.</p>
  
      <p>This, too, was a failure.</p>
  
      <p>The gods grew angry.</p>
  
      <p>"They do not honor us," Heart of Sky thundered. "Then let them know suffering."</p>
  
      <p>And so, the punishment began.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>Resolution ‚Äì The Destruction of the Wooden People</h2>
      <p><strong>Revenge of the Forgotten</strong></p>
  
      <p>The world turned against them.</p>
  
      <p>üî• Their homes collapsed, burying them beneath the ruins.<br>
      üåä The waters rose, drowning the lands in a great flood.<br>
      üêï Their dogs and turkeys, once their servants, turned upon them, biting and clawing in fury.<br>
      ü™® Their pots and grinding stones rose from the kitchens, striking them in vengeance.</p>
  
      <p>"You have beaten us!" the stones cried. "Now we beat you!"</p>
  
      <p>"You have eaten us without thanks!" the dogs howled. "Now we shall eat you!"</p>
  
      <p>The Wooden People ran, but there was no escape.</p>
  
      <p>The few who survived fled into the forests.</p>
  
      <p>Over time, their bodies twisted and changed.</p>
  
      <p>Their faces stretched into long snouts.<br>
      Their hands curled into paws.<br>
      Their voices became echoes of the wind.</p>
  
      <p>They were no longer human.</p>
  
      <p>The gods left them in the trees, swinging from the branches.</p>
  
      <p>The descendants of the Wooden People still exist.</p>
  
      <p>Today, we call them monkeys.</p>
  
      <p>The gods stood in silence.</p>
  
      <p>"Twice we have failed," Sovereign Plumed Serpent murmured.</p>
  
      <p>"But we are not finished," Heart of Sky replied. "The true people have yet to be born."</p>
  
      <p>And so, the gods turned their eyes to the sacred fields, where the maize swayed in the wind.</p>
  
      <p>Their greatest creation was yet to come.</p>
