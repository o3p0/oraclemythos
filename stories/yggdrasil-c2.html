            <h2>The Whispers Beneath the Roots</h2>
            <p><strong>"I saw beyond the veil of time, beyond life and death, and what I saw cannot be unspoken." — Odin, after his sacrifice</strong></p>
            <p>After nine days and nights hanging from Yggdrasil, Odin returned not as the god who sought wisdom, but as the god burdened by it. The runes carved into his soul whispered of a future written long before the gods claimed their thrones—a future where even Yggdrasil, the Axis of the Nine Realms, would tremble.</p>
            <p>In the shadow of the World Tree, beneath the tangled roots that drank from the Well of Urd, Odin stood before the Norns—Urd (What Was), Verdandi (What Is), and Skuld (What Shall Be). Their fingers wove threads of fate, indifferent to the cries of gods or mortals caught in their weave.</p>
            <p>Odin demanded answers, but the Norns offered only riddles:</p>
            <p><strong>"Fate is not a path you walk, Allfather. It is the ground beneath your feet."</strong></p>
            <p>Yet Odin had seen enough. His visions, carved deep into the marrow of his mind, spoke of a darkness that would drown the realms—a reckoning called Ragnarök.</p>

            <h2>The Shadows of What Must Come</h2>
            <p><strong>"I saw the wolf break his chains. I saw the sky bleed fire. I saw the gods fall."</strong></p>
            <p>Odin’s mind unraveled with images too vivid to be dreams:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Wolf Unbound:</strong> The monstrous wolf Fenrir, long bound by divine chains, shatters his fetters with a roar that echoes through the realms. His jaws stretch wide enough to devour the very sun.</li>
                <li><strong>The Serpent’s Wrath:</strong> From the depths of the sea, the serpent Jörmungandr stirs, his coils suffocating the oceans, his venom darkening the skies.</li>
                <li><strong>The Fire’s March:</strong> In Muspelheim, the fire giant Surtr sharpens his flaming sword, his eyes reflecting the end of worlds. When he marches, even the heavens will burn.</li>
                <li><strong>The Breaking of Bonds:</strong> Loki, the trickster bound by betrayal and rage, slips free, leading an army of chaos—giants, beasts, and the dead—against the gods he once called kin.</li>
                <li><strong>The Fall of the Gods:</strong> Odin himself stands on a battlefield soaked in blood, locked in mortal combat with Fenrir. He sees Thor, the thunder god, strike down Jörmungandr, only to stumble and fall, poison searing through his veins.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And through it all, Yggdrasil trembles—its roots cracking, its branches aflame, its ancient heart groaning beneath the weight of cosmic ruin.</p>
            <p>But even in his darkest vision, Odin saw more than death. He saw two figures, hidden deep within Yggdrasil’s roots, survivors cradled in the arms of the World Tree, destined to rebuild in the ashes of what was lost.</p>

            <h2>The Gathering of the Gods</h2>
            <p><strong>"We cannot escape what is woven. But we can choose how we meet it." — Odin</strong></p>
            <p>Awakened from his visions, Odin’s face was a mask carved from stone, his eye dark with knowledge no god should bear. He called forth the gods of Asgard—mighty Thor, fierce Freya, wise Tyr, and even the bound trickster Loki. Beneath the shadow of Yggdrasil, he spoke of the coming storm.</p>
            <p>Some gods laughed, their pride louder than their fear. Others listened, their hands tightening on weapons destined to break.</p>
            <p>Odin’s words were not a warning. They were a call.</p>
            <p><strong>"Prepare the Einherjar, the fallen warriors of Valhalla. Sharpen your blades. Steel your hearts. Ragnarök is not a myth—it is a memory waiting to happen."</strong></p>
            <p>But deep beneath Yggdrasil, beyond the reach of gods and fate, Níðhöggr stirred. The dragon gnawed at the roots of the World Tree, its hunger growing, its whispers seeping through the soil:</p>
            <p><strong>"Even the gods will feed me in the end."</strong></p>
            <p>—To be continued in Chapter 3: The Binding of Fenrir.</p>
