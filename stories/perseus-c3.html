            <h2>The Hero’s Burden</h2>
            <p><strong>Carrying More Than a Trophy</strong></p>
            <p>With Medusa’s head secured in the magical satchel, Perseus soared above the lands, his feet guided by Hermes’ winged sandals. But victory is a fragile thing. Though the Gorgon was dead, her power lived on—her gaze still capable of turning the living into stone.</p>
            <p>Perseus carried not just a weapon, but a curse.</p>

            <h2>The Battle for Andromeda</h2>
            <p><strong>From Stone to Flesh, from Death to Life</strong></p>
            <p>As the sea roared, the monstrous creature emerged—a towering beast with scales like iron, eyes like burning coals, and jaws wide enough to swallow ships whole. The crowd watched from the cliffs, silent and helpless, expecting to witness a sacrifice.</p>
            <p>But Perseus did not hesitate.</p>
            <p>Hovering above the waves, he drew the adamantine sword—the same blade that had slain Medusa. Yet even with divine weapons, the beast was relentless, thrashing with fury, its tentacles lashing like whips.</p>
            <p>Realizing brute force would not be enough, Perseus reached for his ultimate weapon. He unveiled Medusa’s head, its dead eyes still burning with cursed power. The creature’s roar turned into a petrified scream as its massive form hardened into stone, crashing into the sea like a fallen mountain.</p>

            <h2>The King’s Reckoning</h2>
            <p><strong>Justice Wears Many Faces</strong></p>
            <p>With Andromeda by his side, Perseus returned to Seriphos, the island where his journey began. But he did not return to peace.</p>
            <p>Polydectes, the king who had sent Perseus on his doomed quest, had tormented Danaë in his absence. Perseus entered the king’s hall and, with a single gaze from Medusa’s head, turned Polydectes and his court to stone.</p>
            <p>With his quest fulfilled, Perseus presented Medusa’s head to Athena, who placed it upon her Aegis—forever a symbol of protection and divine justice.</p>
            <p>—The End of the Tale of Perseus and Medusa.</p>
