      <h2>Setup â€“ The Gods Demand Justice</h2>
      <p><strong>Chapter 8 â€“ Clash of the Gods: Fire Against Iron</strong></p>
  
      <p>The heavens rumbled. The ground beneath Oyo trembled. The time for reckoning had come.</p>
  
      <p>Sango stood at the peak of a sacred hill, lightning crackling in his palms. His red and white robes billowed in the storm winds, his eyes burning with defiance. Across from him, the mighty Ogun stood firmâ€”his body gleaming like polished iron, his great sword resting against his shoulder.</p>
  
      <p>"You have broken the balance, Sango," Ogunâ€™s voice was like the grinding of metal. "You were meant to rule with strength, not fury. You let anger consume you, and now the gods have sent me to stop you."</p>
  
      <p>Sango smirked, gripping his twin axes tighter. "Stop me? No, Ogunâ€”youâ€™re here to test me. I have become more than a king. I am thunder itself!"</p>
  
      <p>Above them, the sky flashed white as the Orishas watched in silence. The battle of fire and iron was about to begin.</p>

      <h2>Conflict & Action â€“ The Battle That Shook the Heavens</h2>
      <p><strong>The Battle That Shook the Heavens</strong></p>
  
      <p>Ogun charged first, his iron sword slicing through the air. Sango leaped back, summoning lightning to strike the bladeâ€”but Ogun did not falter. He swung again, sparks flying as Sango blocked with his axes.</p>
  
      <p>Clash! Crack! Boom!</p>
  
      <p>Each blow sent tremors through the earth. Mountains shook. Rivers split. The sky bled red with their fury.</p>
  
      <p>Ogunâ€™s strikes were precise, his power unyielding. He was war itself. But Sango was not just a warriorâ€”he was a storm.</p>
  
      <p>With a roar, Sango threw his axes, summoning a wall of flame between them. Ogun broke through with sheer strength, but Sango was already in the air, calling down a bolt of lightningâ€”directly into Ogunâ€™s chest.</p>
  
      <p>Ogun staggered. Smoke curled from his armor. But he did not fall. Instead, he laughed.</p>
  
      <p>"Good," Ogun said, standing tall. "Now prove you can finish it!"</p>
  
      <p>Sango clenched his fists. His heart thundered in his chest. The sky screamed with electricity. But something deep inside him hesitated.</p>

      <h2>Resolution & Cliffhanger â€“ The Lesson of the Orishas</h2>
      <p><strong>The Lesson of the Orishas</strong></p>
  
      <p>Sango raised his hands, ready to summon one final strikeâ€”but then, he stopped.</p>
  
      <p>For the first time, he truly saw Ogun.</p>
  
      <p>Ogun had not fought him to kill him. He had fought him to teach him.</p>
  
      <p>Sango could win this battleâ€”but at what cost? Would he burn down everything just to prove his power? Would he fall into the same rage that had once destroyed his kingdom?</p>
  
      <p>Slowly, Sango lowered his arms. The storm calmed. The fire dimmed.</p>
  
      <p>Ogun nodded in approval. "You understand now."</p>
  
      <p>Sango exhaled, his hands still shaking with power. "This was never about strength. It was about control."</p>
  
      <p>Ogun stepped forward, resting a heavy hand on Sangoâ€™s shoulder. "You have the power of thunder, Sango. But thunder is not just destruction. It is also a warning, a guide, a protector. Do not forget that."</p>
  
      <p>Above them, the Orishas murmured in approval. The battle was over. But Sangoâ€™s final trial was yet to come.</p>
  
      <p>Would he embrace his divinity? Or would he still cling to the man he had been?</p>
