      <h2>Setup – The Call to Adventure</h2>
      <p><strong>The Birth of the Divine Prince</strong></p>
  
      <p>The weight of the cosmos trembled under the shadow of Ravana, the demon king of Lanka. His power was unchecked, his tyranny stretching across the heavens and earth. Even the gods feared his wrath, for no force in existence could challenge him.</p>
  
      <p>But the universe does not allow darkness to reign forever. A prophecy whispered through the celestial halls—Vishnu, the Preserver, would descend to restore dharma.</p>
  
      <p>In the kingdom of Ayodhya, King Dasharatha, ruler of the Ikshvaku dynasty, longed for an heir. The gods answered his prayers with a sacred boon. From the flames of a divine ritual, a golden nectar emerged—a gift from the heavens. The king’s queens drank of it, and soon, destiny took shape.</p>
  
      <p>Rama was born. His presence was like the dawn breaking through the longest night. He was no mere prince; he was dharma incarnate, the very balance of the cosmos given mortal form.</p>
  
      <p>Years passed, and Rama grew into a warrior of unmatched grace and wisdom. His name echoed through the land—a prince not just of Ayodhya, but of righteousness itself. When the time came for him to choose a bride, fate led him to the kingdom of Mithila, where a test of divine strength awaited.</p>
  
      <p>The bow of Shiva—a weapon of the gods—lay before him, unmoved by any mortal hand. Many had tried to lift it. All had failed. But as Rama stepped forward, his touch alone stirred the heavens. With a single, fluid motion, he lifted the bow and bent it until it snapped like a bolt of lightning.</p>
  
      <p>Thus, he won the heart of Sita, daughter of King Janaka, a woman whose virtue and strength would one day be tested by fire. Their union was not just a marriage; it was the binding of fate itself.</p>
  
      <p>But fate is cruel. And the gods were not yet finished shaping Rama’s path.</p>

      <h2>Conflict & Action – The Challenge</h2>
      <p><strong>The Price of a Promise</strong></p>
  
      <p>The city of Ayodhya was bathed in golden light, its people rejoicing, for the time had come—Rama would be crowned king. The kingdom awaited its most noble ruler, and dharma would reign supreme.</p>
  
      <p>But in the shadows of the palace, ambition whispered. Kaikeyi, one of King Dasharatha’s wives, harbored a forgotten boon, granted to her in a moment of past valor. With venom in her voice, she made her demand:</p>
  
      <p>"Banish Rama to the forest for fourteen years. Let Bharata be king."</p>
  
      <p>Dasharatha’s heart shattered. The very breath of his soul was torn from him, but a king’s word is iron, and a promise, once given, cannot be undone.</p>
  
      <p>The court fell silent as Rama stood before his father, his face serene as the still waters of a sacred river. He did not argue. He did not resist. He simply bowed his head.</p>
  
      <p>"If exile is my duty, then exile I shall embrace."</p>
  
      <p>Sita’s voice rang out in defiance. "Where my husband walks, I shall walk beside him." No force, not even exile, could sever her devotion.</p>
  
      <p>Lakshmana, Rama’s younger brother, burned with fury. "I will not stay behind. Let the comforts of the palace rot—my place is at my brother’s side."</p>
  
      <p>Thus, the three departed. Ayodhya, once filled with joy, was now drowned in sorrow.</p>
  
      <p>Dasharatha, his spirit broken, called out to the heavens. "My son, my Rama… my life follows you into the forest."</p>
  
      <p>His words rang true. That very night, grief consumed the old king, and he breathed his last.</p>
  
      <p>But Rama did not turn back. His path was set, and destiny had only begun its cruel work.</p>

      <h2>Resolution & Cliffhanger – The Payoff</h2>
      <p><strong>Into the Wilderness, Into Fate</strong></p>
  
      <p>Barefoot and clad in the robes of an ascetic, Rama walked into the heart of the unknown. The golden spires of Ayodhya faded behind him, swallowed by the dense shadows of the forest. The cries of his people still echoed in his mind, but his heart did not waver.</p>
  
      <p>Beside him, Sita and Lakshmana walked in silence. They had left behind a kingdom, but they had not left behind their purpose.</p>
  
      <p>Deeper and deeper they ventured, the towering trees whispering secrets of ancient beings, the rivers flowing with the echoes of lost civilizations.</p>
  
      <p>But beyond the trees, beyond the rivers, something stirred.</p>
  
      <p>Far across the sea, in the dark kingdom of Lanka, Ravana sat upon his throne. The air trembled with his laughter, the scent of war thick upon the winds.</p>
  
      <p>For the wheels of fate had begun to turn. And soon, the world would burn.</p>
