      <h2>A Sun That Will Not Move</h2>
      <p><strong>The Heavens Remain Still</strong></p>
      <p>The gods looked to the sky.</p>
      <p>The fire of creation had done its work.</p>
      <p>‚òÄÔ∏è Nanahuatzin had risen‚Äîhis light golden, his face ablaze, illuminating the void.<br>üåô Tecciztecatl had followed‚Äîbut his glow was pale, his presence weak.</p>
      <p>The sun and moon had been born.</p>
      <p>And yet, something was wrong.</p>
      <p>They did not move.</p>
      <p>The heavens remained frozen, the sun hanging motionless, casting no warmth upon the earth.</p>
      <p>The gods murmured among themselves.</p>
      <p>"Why does he not journey across the sky?"<br>"Why does the world remain lifeless?"</p>
      <p>Then, the truth struck them.</p>
      <p>"We have given the sun life," one god whispered. "But he has not been fed."</p>
      <p>Nanahuatzin had sacrificed himself, but for the Fifth Sun to truly rise, he would need one final offering.</p>
      <p>The gods looked at each other.</p>
      <p>They knew what had to be done.</p>

    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>The Last Offering</h2>
      <p><strong>The Gods Must Die</strong></p>
      <p>The gods stood before Tezcatlipoca, the Smoking Mirror, the great and shadowed one.</p>
      <p>He, who knew the secrets of life and death, spoke first.</p>
      <p>"The sun demands blood," he said. "We must give ourselves."</p>
      <p>A silence fell over the heavens.</p>
      <p>These were the gods of creation‚Äîthe architects of the world. Without them, who would rule? Who would shape destiny?</p>
      <p>But there was no other way.</p>
      <p>For the sun to move, for the new age to begin, they would have to offer their own lives.</p>
      <p>The gods nodded.</p>
      <p>One by one, they stepped forward.</p>
      <p>Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent, the bringer of wisdom, placed his hand over his heart.<br>
         Tlaloc, the Rain Giver, the bringer of storms, bowed his head.<br>
         Chalchiuhtlicue, the Lady of Water, the mother of rivers and lakes, raised her arms to the sky.</p>
      <p>And Tezcatlipoca, the smoke and shadow, smiled one last time.</p>
      <p>Then, with one swift motion, they cut open their chests, letting their blood spill upon the earth.</p>
      <p>The heavens shook.<br>The wind howled.<br>The ground drank the blood of the gods.</p>
      <p>And at last, the sun began to move.</p>

      <h2>The Birth of the Fifth Sun</h2>
      <p><strong>A World Sustained by Blood</strong></p>
      <p>The sun rose, slowly at first, then faster‚Äîascending into the sky, illuminating the world with its fire.</p>
      <p>The Fifth Sun had begun its journey.</p>
      <p>But the gods were gone.</p>
      <p>Their bodies lay scattered. Their essence had merged with the cosmos.</p>
      <p>The world would never forget what they had done.</p>
      <p>And so, the gods gave their final decree:</p>
      <p>"The sun will rise, but it will always hunger."<br>"As we have given our blood, so too must humanity."</p>
      <p>And thus, the Aztecs came to understand their duty.</p>
      <p>To sustain the Fifth Sun, to keep the world alive, they would offer blood and sacrifice.</p>
      <p>Their own, and that of warriors taken in battle.</p>
      <p>For as long as the sun moved, its fire must be fed.</p>
      <p>And so, the world of the Fifth Sun was born.</p>
