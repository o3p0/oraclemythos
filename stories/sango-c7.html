      <h2>Setup â€“ The Return to the Mortal World</h2>
      <p><strong>Chapter 7: The Thunder God Walks Among Men</strong></p>
  
      <p>âš¡ðŸ”¥ Sango has claimed his place among the Orishaâ€¦ but his true purpose is yet to be revealed. ðŸ”¥âš¡</p>
  
      <p>The storm had passed.</p>
  
      <p>Sango stood upon the mountainâ€™s peak, the wind whispering his name, the sky heavy with the scent of rain and fire.</p>
  
      <p>He was no longer a mere warrior. No longer a fallen king.</p>
  
      <p>He had become something more.</p>
  
      <p>Yet, a question burned within him. What now?</p>
  
      <p>"The gods rule the heavens," he murmured. "But my fate was never in the sky."</p>
  
      <p>Then, from behind him, Oya stepped forward.</p>
  
      <p>Her gaze was fierce, unreadableâ€”like the winds before a great storm.</p>
  
      <p>"You have learned to master the storm," she said. "But will the world accept what you have become?"</p>
  
      <p>Sango frowned. "The world does not need to accept me. They will feel my power."</p>
  
      <p>Oya did not answer. She only lifted her hand.</p>
  
      <p>The clouds began to swirl once more, but this time, they did not threaten destruction. Instead, they partedâ€”revealing the world below.</p>
  
      <p>ðŸ”¥âš¡ The kingdoms of men still stood. The people still prayed. But something had changed. âš¡ðŸ”¥</p>
  
      <p>Sango narrowed his eyes. "Take me back."</p>

    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>Conflict & Action â€“ A King No Longer?</h2>
      <p><strong>A King No Longer?</strong></p>
  
      <p>The moment his feet touched the earth, Sango felt the difference.</p>
  
      <p>Once, his name had carried weight. His presence had commanded armies. Now?</p>
  
      <p>The people stared in fear.</p>
  
      <p>ðŸ”¥ Lightning flickered in his eyes. The air crackled around him. ðŸ”¥</p>
  
      <p>He was no longer a king. He was something they could not understand.</p>
  
      <p>"It is him," the whispers began. "Sangoâ€¦ but not as he was."</p>
  
      <p>The elders of Oyo approached cautiously. They had mourned his fall, but now they did not know what stood before them.</p>
  
      <p>"Sango," the eldest one spoke, "you vanished into the storm. You return nowâ€¦ but you are no longer of this world."</p>
  
      <p>Sango clenched his fists. He had returned to restore his people, yet they feared him.</p>
  
      <p>The sky darkened above him. Thunder rolled, low and deep.</p>
  
      <p>Then, a voice called out. Not in fearâ€¦ but in challenge.</p>
  
      <p>"A god does not walk among men!"</p>
  
      <p>A warrior stepped forward, spear in hand, eyes burning with defiance.</p>
  
      <p>ðŸ”¥âš¡ Ogun, the Orisha of Iron. âš¡ðŸ”¥</p>

      <h2>Resolution & Cliffhanger â€“ The Clash of Fire and Iron</h2>
      <p><strong>The Clash of Fire and Iron</strong></p>
  
      <p>Sango turned to face him. Two forces, equal in strength, yet opposite in nature.</p>
  
      <p>ðŸ”¥ Fire against metal. Thunder against steel. ðŸ”¥</p>
  
      <p>"You are not meant to rule here anymore, Sango," Ogun warned. "The ways of gods and mortals do not mix."</p>
  
      <p>Sango growled. "I was born a king. I will not be cast aside like a forgotten storm."</p>
  
      <p>Ogun raised his spear.</p>
  
      <p>"Then prove you belong."</p>
  
      <p>The air tensed. The heavens trembled.</p>
  
      <p>ðŸ”¥âš¡ The God of Storms and the God of Iron would battle. And the earth would shake beneath their fury. âš¡ðŸ”¥</p>
