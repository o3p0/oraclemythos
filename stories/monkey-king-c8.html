    <h2>Setup – The Last Trial</h2>
    <p><strong>🐵🔥 One final battle. One final lesson. Will Sun Wukong prove he is more than a warrior?</strong></p>

    <p>🏯 The pilgrimage was nearing its end.</p>
    <p>🌅 The sun cast golden light over the mountains, yet a shadow loomed ahead.</p>
    <p>🐵 Sun Wukong strode forward, his golden staff gleaming. He had fought demons, defied gods, and even faced exile—but this felt different.</p>
    <p>🙏 Tang Sanzang halted. His voice was soft, yet firm.</p>
    <p>🙏 "Wukong, your final trial awaits."</p>
    <p>🐵 "Another demon to slay?" the Monkey King smirked, spinning his staff.</p>
    <p>🙏 "No." The monk met his disciple’s eyes. "You must face yourself."</p>
    <p>⚡ The air trembled. A blinding flash split the heavens.</p>
    <p>🐵 And from the golden light—stepped another Sun Wukong.</p>
    <p>🔥 A perfect reflection. His past self. Unchained. Unhindered. Untamed.</p>
    <p>🐵 "So," Wukong muttered. "I am my own enemy?"</p>
    <p>👿 The Mirror-Wukong grinned.<br>👿 "No, fool. I am who you used to be."</p>
    <p>👿 "The Great Sage Equal to Heaven."</p>

    <h2>Conflict – The Battle Against Himself</h2>

    <p>⚔️ The two Monkey Kings clashed, their staffs striking like thunder.</p>
    <p>💥 The ground shattered beneath them.</p>
    <p>🐵 Wukong fought with all his might—but his opponent matched him blow for blow.</p>
    <p>👿 "You’ve grown weak, Wukong!" the Mirror sneered. "You were once fearless! Now, you serve a mere monk?"</p>
    <p>🐵 "I serve no one," Wukong spat, swinging his staff.</p>
    <p>🔥 The Mirror laughed, dodging easily.</p>
    <p>👿 "Then why do you hesitate? Strike me down! Prove you are still the warrior you once were!"</p>
    <p>🐵 Wukong froze.</p>
    <p>🐵 Why did I hesitate?</p>
    <p>👿 "Admit it," the Mirror whispered. "You have lost yourself."</p>
    <p>🐵 Wukong’s grip tightened. He had spent his life fighting—fighting heaven, fighting demons, fighting his own master’s doubts.</p>
    <p>🐵 But was fighting the only way?</p>
    <p>🙏 "Strength without wisdom is a beast’s burden."</p>
    <p>🐵 Tang Sanzang’s voice echoed in his mind.</p>
    <p>🐵 And in that moment, he understood.</p>
    <p>🌪️ Wukong lowered his staff.</p>
    <p>👿 "What are you doing?" the Mirror snarled.</p>
    <p>🐵 "I am choosing."</p>
    <p>🐵 "For once—I will not fight."</p>
    <p>👿 The Mirror-Wukong roared, charging—</p>
    <p>⚡ And then—he vanished.</p>
    <p>💨 Dissolving like mist in the morning sun.</p>
    <p>🐵 The battle had never been against an enemy.<br>🐵 It was against himself.</p>
    <p>🐵 And he had won.</p>

  <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
    <h2>Resolution – The Golden Headband is Removed</h2>

    <p>🙏 Tang Sanzang stepped forward.</p>
    <p>🙏 "You understand now, Wukong."</p>
    <p>🐵 Wukong nodded.</p>
    <p>🐵 "Power is nothing without wisdom."</p>
    <p>🐵 "Loyalty is nothing without choice."</p>
    <p>🐵 "And I am nothing—if I do not choose who I am."</p>
    <p>🌅 The first light of dawn broke over the horizon.</p>
    <p>⚡ Tang Sanzang raised his hand—and the Golden Headband glowed.</p>
    <p>🔥 With a final whisper of energy—it vanished.</p>
    <p>🐵 Sun Wukong touched his forehead. For the first time in centuries, he was free.</p>
    <p>🙏 "You were never bound by the headband, Wukong."</p>
    <p>🙏 "You were bound by your past."</p>
    <p>🐵 The Monkey King smiled. A real, true smile.</p>
    <p>🐵 "Then I suppose it’s time to move forward."</p>
    <p>🐵 "Come, Master. We have a journey to finish."</p>
    <p>🏯 The pilgrimage continued—but Wukong walked not as a warrior, not as a rebel…</p>
    <p>🔥 But as a protector.</p>
