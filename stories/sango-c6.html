      <h2>Setup â€“ The Awakening of Power</h2>
      <p><strong>Chapter 6: The Orisha of Storms</strong></p>
  
      <p>âš¡ Sango has risen, but what does it mean to be a god? Power is one thingâ€¦ but control? That is another. ðŸ”¥</p>
  
      <p>The sky rumbled.</p>
  
      <p>Storm clouds gathered over the mountain, swirling in a great vortex of fire and thunder. At its center stood Sango, no longer just a fallen kingâ€”but something more.</p>
  
      <p>His body hummed with energy, his veins crackled with raw lightning. Each breath stirred the winds.</p>
  
      <p>Yet, as he lifted his hands, a terrible truth became clear.</p>
  
      <p>The storm was not his to command.</p>
  
      <p>The heavens shook violently, uncontrolled. Thunder boomed across the land, rivers swelled with restless power, and the trees bent under the force of a brewing hurricane.</p>
  
      <p>ðŸ”¥ Sango had become an Orishaâ€¦ but he had not yet mastered the storm.</p>
  
      <p>He clenched his fists. The sky roared louder. Was this his power? Or his curse?</p>
  
      <p>Then, from the winds, a voice whispered.</p>
  
      <p>"You are not alone."</p>

      <h2>Conflict & Action â€“ The Dance of Storm and Wind</h2>
      <p><strong>The Dance of Storm and Wind</strong></p>
  
      <p>A gust of wind whipped through the trees, spiraling into a raging cyclone. Within it, a figure emergedâ€”her presence undeniable.</p>
  
      <p>Oya.</p>
  
      <p>ðŸ”¥ The Orisha of Winds and Tempests. ðŸ”¥</p>
  
      <p>Her robes billowed like storm clouds, her eyes burned with fierce knowing. Where Sango was fire, she was wind. Where he was thunder, she was the storm that carried it.</p>
  
      <p>"You think power alone makes you a god?" she asked.</p>
  
      <p>Sango glared. "I do not think. I know."</p>
  
      <p>Lightning struck at his command, splitting the sky in two. Yet the storm did not bow. It raged beyond him, wild and untamed.</p>
  
      <p>Oya laughedâ€”a sound like the rushing wind before a great flood.<br>
      "Then prove it."</p>
  
      <p>She lifted her arms. The storm obeyed her. The winds surged, the land trembled. The heavens became their battlefield.</p>
  
      <p>Sango unleashed his fury. Lightning rained down. The sky burned with his fire. But each strike was swallowed by the winds, redirected, turned against him.</p>
  
      <p>ðŸ”¥âš¡ Fire against wind. Thunder against storm. The two forces clashedâ€”unstoppable, untamed. âš¡ðŸ”¥</p>
  
      <p>The earth trembled beneath the power of the gods.</p>
  
      <p>Then, in the chaos, Sango saw the truth.</p>
  
      <p>The storm was not meant to be dominated.</p>
  
      <p>It was meant to be guided.</p>

      <h2>Resolution & Cliffhanger â€“ The Balance of Power</h2>
      <p><strong>The Balance of Power</strong></p>
  
      <p>Sango lowered his hands. The storm still raged, but nowâ€¦ he listened.</p>
  
      <p>He felt the windâ€™s rhythm. He saw the path of the lightning before it struck.</p>
  
      <p>Instead of fighting against it, he moved with it.</p>
  
      <p>Oya watched carefully.</p>
  
      <p>For the first time, Sango did not force the storm to obey. He let it breathe, let it roar, let it be both destruction and creation.</p>
  
      <p>And thenâ€¦</p>
  
      <p>ðŸ”¥âš¡ The storm bowed to him. âš¡ðŸ”¥</p>
  
      <p>The winds did not vanishâ€”but they no longer threatened to consume him. The lightning no longer burned uncontrolled, but crackled with purpose.</p>
  
      <p>Oya smiled. "Now, you are truly Sango."</p>
  
      <p>Sango met her gaze. No longer just a warrior. No longer just a fallen king.</p>
  
      <p>Now, he was the Orisha of Storms.</p>
