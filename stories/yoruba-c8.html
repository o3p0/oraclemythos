      <h2>Setup â€“ The Ocean Rises in Anger</h2>
      <p><strong>The Wrath of Olokun â€“ The Flood of the Gods ðŸŒŠâš¡</strong></p>
  
      <p>The world had flourished, the land was fertile, and humans had learned the ways of sacrifice. The Orishas watched as humanity grew, spreading across Ile-Ife, the sacred land.</p>
  
      <p>But not all the gods were pleased.</p>
  
      <p>Far beneath the waves, in the depths of the endless sea, Olokun, the Orisha of the Ocean, stirred. The great goddess of the deep had been ignored in the creation of the world. The land had been shaped, rivers had flowed, trees had risenâ€”but the waters, her domain, had not been honored.</p>
  
      <p>And she had been silent long enough.</p>
  
      <p>"They have forgotten who rules the deepest part of this world," Olokun murmured, her voice rising like a storm. "They take from the land, but they do not ask the sea for its blessing."</p>
  
      <p>A great anger rose within her, as deep and dark as the ocean floor.</p>
  
      <p>She would remind them.</p>

      <h2>Conflict & Action â€“ The Great Flood Begins</h2>
      <p><strong>The Great Flood Begins</strong></p>
  
      <p>Without warning, the skies darkened. The winds howled through the trees. The rivers, once calm, swelled with fury.</p>
  
      <p>The people of Ile-Ife looked up in fear. The earth trembled. The sea raged. And thenâ€”</p>
  
      <p>The flood came.</p>
  
      <p>Great waves rose from the shores, crashing into villages, sweeping away homes and crops. The rivers overflowed, drowning the land in a torrent of divine anger.</p>
  
      <p>The Orishas watched from the heavens. "Olokun is furious," Orunmila said, his eyes filled with knowing. "If we do not act, the world will be lost."</p>
  
      <p>But Olokunâ€™s power was unmatched in the waters. The flood could not be stopped.</p>
  
      <p>Only one Orisha could calm her rage.</p>
  
      <p>Obatala, the sculptor of humanity, the creator of the land, stepped forward.</p>
  
      <p>"It was I who shaped the world. It must be I who saves it."</p>
  
      <p>He descended from Orun, stepping into the chaos of the storm.</p>
  
      <p>With each step, the floodwaters rose higher.</p>

      <h2>Resolution & Cliffhanger â€“ The Bargain with Olokun</h2>
      <p><strong>The Bargain with Olokun</strong></p>
  
      <p>Obatala stood at the edge of the roaring sea, his white robes soaked, his voice steady.</p>
  
      <p>"Olokun, mighty ruler of the waters, hear me!" he called. "The people have wronged you, but let them make amends. Let balance be restored."</p>
  
      <p>The waters churned, rising higher. Then, from the depths, Olokun appeared.</p>
  
      <p>Her form was vast, shifting like the tidesâ€”her skin the color of the deep sea, her hair flowing like waves, her eyes dark as the abyss.</p>
  
      <p>"Why should I stop?" she asked, her voice rolling like thunder. "The land was made without my blessing. Let the waters take back what is mine."</p>
  
      <p>Obatala bowed his head.</p>
  
      <p>"Then let there be a pact," he said. "The earth and sea must be honored together. The people will give offerings to both, so neither shall be forgotten."</p>
  
      <p>For a long moment, Olokun was silent. The waves raged, the rain poured, the winds screamed.</p>
  
      <p>Thenâ€”slowlyâ€”the waters began to recede.</p>
  
      <p>The flood was over.</p>
  
      <p>But the lesson had been learned.</p>
  
      <p>From that day forward, the people of Ile-Ife honored both land and sea. They made offerings to Olokun, asking for safe passage on the waters, for rain in times of drought, for peace between the elements.</p>
  
      <p>Balance had been restoredâ€”but the gods had more trials yet to come.</p>
