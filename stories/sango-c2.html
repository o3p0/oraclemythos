      <h2>Setup â€“ The Kingâ€™s Restlessness</h2>
      <p><strong>Chapter 2: The Storm King Awakens âš¡ðŸ”¥</strong></p>
  
      <p>Sango sat upon his throne in Oyo, yet his heart was restless. Though he had strength greater than any warrior, though his voice commanded armies, it was not enough. He longed for something moreâ€”for power that would make him not just a king, but a force of nature.</p>
  
      <p>He had heard the whispers of the elders. They spoke of the Orishas, the divine spirits who shaped the world. They told stories of Shango, the god of thunder, and his mastery of lightning. Could a mere mortal hold such power?</p>
  
      <p>One night, beneath the glow of a blood-red moon, Sango made a choice. He would seek the knowledge of the storm, no matter the cost.</p>
  
      <p>With his closest warriors, he traveled beyond the borders of Oyo, through thick forests and shadowed paths, searching for the wisdom that only the gods could grant.</p>
  
      <p>And then, on the seventh night, he found it.</p>

      <h2>Conflict & Action â€“ The Sacred Encounter</h2>
      <p><strong>The Sacred Encounter</strong></p>
  
      <p>Deep in the wilderness, in a grove where no mortal dared tread, an old priest sat beside a great iron cauldron. His eyes glowed like embers, his skin bore the marks of ancient knowledge. This was a servant of Orunmila, the god of wisdom.</p>
  
      <p>"You seek the fire of the gods," the priest said, his voice like distant thunder. "But fire does not belong to men. It devours, it consumes. Once it touches you, it will never leave."</p>
  
      <p>Sango did not hesitate. "I was born to rule with strength. If fire and lightning will make me a true king, then let them burn through me."</p>
  
      <p>The priest studied him for a long moment. Then he reached into the cauldron and pulled forth a glowing stone, humming with power. "Take this," he said, "but know that it is not a giftâ€”it is a burden. You will wield the storm, but the storm will also wield you."</p>
  
      <p>Sango grasped the stone. In that instant, his body convulsed as a searing force coursed through his veins. The sky above them rumbled. He felt his hands spark with energy, his breath thick with smoke.</p>
  
      <p>Then, the storm came.</p>
  
      <p>Lightning cracked the heavens, striking the ground at his feet. Fire danced at his fingertips. Sango had become the storm itself.</p>

      <h2>Resolution & Cliffhanger â€“ The King of Thunder</h2>
      <p><strong>The King of Thunder</strong></p>
  
      <p>When Sango returned to Oyo, the people trembled in awe. No longer was he just a warrior-kingâ€”he was something greater.</p>
  
      <p>With a wave of his hand, he could summon fire from the skies. With a stomp of his foot, the earth trembled. His warriors rejoiced, for they knew no enemy could stand against him now.</p>
  
      <p>But there were others who watched in fear.</p>
  
      <p>The elders whispered, their voices thick with worry. "A man cannot wield the power of the gods without consequence," they said.</p>
  
      <p>And in the realm of the Orishas, the true Shango, god of storms, turned his gaze toward Oyo.</p>
  
      <p>Sango had claimed the power of lightning.</p>
  
      <p>But would he be strong enough to master it?</p>
