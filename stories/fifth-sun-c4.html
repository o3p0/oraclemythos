      <h2>he Gods Are Gone, But the Sun Remains</h2>
      <p><strong>A World Sustained by Blood</strong></p>
      <p>The gods had fallen.</p>
      <p>Their blood soaked the sacred earth of Teotihuacan. Their bodies had vanished, merging with the forces of the cosmos.</p>
      <p>Yet, their sacrifice had not been in vain.</p>
      <p>‚òÄÔ∏è The sun now moved, crossing the sky for the first time.<br>üåé The world below awakened, bathed in golden light.</p>
      <p>The Fifth Sun had begun its reign.</p>
      <p>But the gods had left behind a final warning.</p>
      <p>The sun was alive, but it would always hunger.</p>
      <p>"As we have given our blood, so too must humanity."</p>
      <p>And so, the duty of sacrifice fell to mortals.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>The Burden of Humanity</h2>
      <p><strong>Blood for the Sun, Life for the World</strong></p>
      <p>The first humans looked up at the sky, feeling its warmth upon their skin.</p>
      <p>They knew the gods had given their lives to set the sun in motion.</p>
      <p>But what if it stopped?</p>
      <p>What if the sky grew dark once more?</p>
      <p>The elders gathered, recalling the last words of the gods.</p>
      <p>"The sun must be fed."</p>
      <p>And so, the first great offering was made.</p>
      <p>Not of gods, but of men.</p>
      <p>A warrior, chosen with honor, stood atop the temple steps.</p>
      <p>Drums thundered. The priest raised his blade. The people chanted the names of the fallen gods.</p>
      <p>The knife fell, and blood spilled‚Äîred as fire, sacred as the dawn.</p>
      <p>The sun did not waver.</p>
      <p>It continued its path, satisfied.</p>
      <p>The people rejoiced.</p>
      <p>The gods had shown them the truth‚ÄîOnly blood could keep the sun alive.</p>
      <p>And so, sacrifice became the law of the Fifth Sun.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>The Eternal Cycle</h2>
      <p><strong>The Sun Will Never Rest</strong></p>
      <p>The world had been reborn.</p>
      <p>But the people knew that this sun, too, would one day die.</p>
      <p>One day, its fire would fade.<br>One day, the Fifth Sun would fall, just as the Four Suns before it had.</p>
      <p>And so, the Aztecs vowed to delay the end.</p>
      <p>To keep the sun moving.<br>To hold back the darkness.<br>To honor the gods who had given all.</p>
      <p>They built great temples, raised mighty pyramids, and waged holy wars to capture warriors for sacrifice.</p>
      <p>They fed the sun with hearts full of life so that it might burn a little longer.</p>
      <p>For they understood the truth of all existence‚Äî</p>
      <p>üî• Only blood keeps the world alive. üî•</p>
      <p><em>‚ÄîThe Age of the Fifth Sun had begun.</em></p>
