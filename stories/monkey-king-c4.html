      <h2>The Gods Admit Defeat</h2>
      <p><strong>Heaven’s Strongest Warrior Has Failed</strong></p>
      <p>🌪️ The battlefield lay in ruins.<br>
      🌩️ The heavenly army had fallen.<br>
      🔥 Laozi’s Golden Furnace had failed.</p>
  
      <p>Sun Wukong stood unscathed, his golden eyes burning with victory.</p>
  
      <p>⚡ "Is there no one left who dares to fight me?" he roared, spinning the Golden-Banded Staff (如意金箍棒).</p>
  
      <p>The gods trembled.<br>
      The Jade Emperor (玉皇大帝), ruler of Heaven itself, sat upon his golden throne—silent.</p>
  
      <p>For the first time in ten thousand years, Heaven was powerless.</p>
  
      <p>No blade could cut Sun Wukong.<br>
      No fire could burn him.<br>
      No chain could bind him.</p>
  
      <p>🌙 The sun dimmed.<br>
      The stars flickered.<br>
      The heavens quaked.</p>
  
      <p>The order of the universe was breaking.</p>
  
      <p>The Jade Emperor had no choice.</p>
  
      <p>🚩 "Summon Buddha." 🚩</p>

      <h2>The Challenge of the Buddha</h2>
      <p><strong>Can the Monkey Escape the Hand of Wisdom?</strong></p>
  
      <p>✨ From the West, a golden light descended. ✨</p>
  
      <p>A figure stepped forward—calm, smiling, unshaken.</p>
  
      <p>🕊️ Buddha (如来佛祖).<br>
      The Enlightened One. The Teacher of All Realms.</p>
  
      <p>Sun Wukong grinned.</p>
  
      <p>⚡ "Another god come to fight?" he mocked.<br>
      ⚡ "No sword, no armor—do you think words alone can stop me?"</p>
  
      <p>Buddha simply raised his hand.</p>
  
      <p>🌱 "Great Sage," he said, "your power is mighty, but tell me—can you truly escape all things?"</p>
  
      <p>Sun Wukong laughed.</p>
  
      <p>🔥 "I can fly across the heavens in a single leap. I can become a dragon, a storm, even the wind itself!"<br>
      🔥 "No one in the universe can hold me!"</p>
  
      <p>Buddha nodded.</p>
  
      <p>🌸 "Then let us test this. If you can leap beyond the reach of my palm, you may rule Heaven itself."</p>
  
      <p>The Monkey King snorted.</p>
  
      <p>🌪️ "Prepare to bow before your new emperor." 🌪️</p>
  
      <p>He somersaulted into the sky, faster than lightning.</p>
  
      <p>🏔️ Past the mountains.<br>
      🌊 Past the seas.<br>
      🌙 Past the stars.</p>
  
      <p>At the edge of the universe, he landed upon five great pillars, marking his victory.</p>
  
      <p>He carved his name into the stone—</p>
  
      <p>✨ "SUN WUKONG, GREAT SAGE EQUAL TO HEAVEN!" ✨</p>
  
      <p>Then, to further mock the gods, he left his mark in the most insulting way possible.</p>
  
      <p>Satisfied, he leapt back to Heaven, laughing.</p>
  
      <p>🔥 "I have escaped your grasp!" he declared.<br>
      🔥 "Now bow to your new ruler!"</p>
  
      <p>But Buddha smiled.</p>
  
      <p>🌿 "Look again," he said.</p>
  
      <p>Sun Wukong turned.</p>
  
      <p>There, upon Buddha’s outstretched hand, were the five great pillars.</p>
  
      <p>🌪️ The sky shattered.<br>
      ⚡ The truth struck him like thunder.<br>
      🔥 He had never left Buddha’s palm.</p>
  
      <p>The illusion was gone.</p>
  
      <p>The Monkey King had lost.</p>

      <h2>The Fall of Sun Wukong</h2>
      <p><strong>The Five-Finger Mountain and 500 Years of Darkness</strong></p>
  
      <p>Sun Wukong roared in defiance.</p>
  
      <p>🔥 He transformed into a beast of flame.<br>
      🔥 He lashed out with his staff.<br>
      🔥 He became a storm, a dragon, a thousand shadows.</p>
  
      <p>But Buddha’s palm closed around him like the sky itself.</p>
  
      <p>The world darkened.<br>
      The heavens shook.</p>
  
      <p>And then—</p>
  
      <p>🌍 BOOM.</p>
  
      <p>A mountain fell from the heavens.</p>
  
      <p>🏔️ The Five-Finger Mountain (五指山).<br>
      🏔️ A prison of divine power.<br>
      🏔️ A tomb of stone and silence.</p>
  
      <p>The Monkey King was trapped.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 No magic could free him.<br>
      🐵 No strength could break the seal.<br>
      🐵 No voice could reach the heavens.</p>
  
      <p>He had challenged fate and lost.</p>
  
      <p>💮 Buddha placed a golden inscription upon the peak:<br>
      "Here lies Sun Wukong, the Monkey Who Defied Heaven."</p>
  
      <p>And for 500 years, he remained beneath the mountain.</p>
  
      <p>🌑 Alone.<br>
      🌑 Forgotten.<br>
      🌑 Waiting.</p>
  
      <p>Until, one day, a lone monk would pass by—a man named Tang Sanzang (唐三藏)—and the Monkey King’s true journey would begin.</p>
