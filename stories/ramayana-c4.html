      <h2>Setup – The Call to Adventure</h2>
      <p><strong>The Final Battle</strong></p>
  
      <p>The battlefield of Lanka lay in ruins—its golden towers blackened with ash, the cries of demons fading into silence. Only two warriors remained standing.</p>
  
      <p>Rama and Ravana.</p>
  
      <p>The demon king, his ten heads still towering, bled from a hundred wounds, yet his arrogance did not waver. His twenty arms wielded celestial weapons, each glowing with deadly power.</p>
  
      <p>From the heavens, the gods watched in silence, knowing that this was no mere duel. This was the final clash of dharma and adharma, righteousness and tyranny.</p>
  
      <p>Ravana raised his final weapon—a spear blessed by Shiva, burning with divine flames. He hurled it at Rama with all his might, but with a single motion, Rama shattered it midair.</p>
  
      <p>Then, from the shadows, Vibhishana, Ravana’s own brother, stepped forward.</p>
  
      <p>"Rama, hear me! Ravana cannot be slain like a mortal man—his life force does not rest in his body."</p>
  
      <p>Rama turned to him, bow drawn. "Then where does it lie?"</p>
  
      <p>Vibhishana’s voice was grave. "His weakness lies in his navel—only a divine weapon can end his reign."</p>
  
      <p>Rama nocked his final arrow—the Brahmastra, forged from the essence of the universe itself.</p>
  
      <p>The winds stilled. The heavens held their breath.</p>
  
      <p>Rama whispered a final prayer and let the arrow fly.</p>
  
      <p>It streaked across the battlefield like a comet, piercing through Ravana’s chest, striking his navel, shattering the last remnants of his immortality.</p>
  
      <p>The demon king staggered, his ten heads falling silent. His arms, once mighty, dropped to his sides. And then, at last, Ravana fell.</p>
  
      <p>His body struck the earth, and the world exhaled.</p>
  
      <p>The great war was over.</p>

      <h2>Conflict & Action – The Challenge</h2>
      <p><strong>The Trial by Fire</strong></p>
  
      <p>The battlefield lay still. Lanka had fallen.</p>
  
      <p>Yet, as Rama turned toward the ruined palace, his victory was incomplete.</p>
  
      <p>Sita stood before him, her eyes shining with hope. She had endured captivity, suffering, and the torment of Ravana’s desires—all in unwavering devotion to Rama.</p>
  
      <p>But as she stepped forward, the air grew heavy with doubt.</p>
  
      <p>The world had seen her in another man’s kingdom. The whispers of mortals and gods alike stained the air with uncertainty.</p>
  
      <p>Then, Rama spoke. His voice was steady, but his words carried the weight of dharma.</p>
  
      <p>"Sita… the world has watched your trial. Though I know your heart is pure, the burden of a king is to be beyond reproach. If you have remained untouched by Ravana, let the gods bear witness."</p>
  
      <p>The words struck like thunder.</p>
  
      <p>Tears glistened in Sita’s eyes, but she did not waver.</p>
  
      <p>"If I am pure, let Agni himself be my judge."</p>
  
      <p>With slow, deliberate steps, Sita walked into the flames.</p>
  
      <p>The fire roared around her, golden tongues rising high, yet she did not scream. She did not burn.</p>
  
      <p>And then—from the inferno emerged Agni, the fire god himself.</p>
  
      <p>He carried Sita in his arms, untouched, unscathed, a goddess among mortals. His voice thundered across the heavens:</p>
  
      <p>"Rama, doubt no longer! Sita is as pure as the sacred waters, untouched by sin, unwavering in love."</p>
  
      <p>The flames died. The test was over.</p>
  
      <p>Rama took Sita’s hand, and for the first time since exile began, the storm had passed.</p>
  
      <p>The time had come to return home.</p>

      <h2>Resolution & Cliffhanger – The Payoff</h2>
      <p><strong>The Return of the King</strong></p>
  
      <p>The skies opened, and from above, the Pushpaka Vimana descended—a celestial chariot, glowing like the morning sun.</p>
  
      <p>With Lakshmana at his side and Sita in his arms, Rama ascended.</p>
  
      <p>The journey back to Ayodhya was swift, the wind carrying them home after fourteen long years of exile.</p>
  
      <p>And as they neared the city, the earth itself seemed to rejoice.</p>
  
      <p>The streets of Ayodhya shone with golden lamps, each home glowing in celebration. Flowers rained from the heavens, and the people wept with joy.</p>
  
      <p>"The prince has returned!"</p>
  
      <p>At the palace gates, Bharata stood waiting, the sandals of Rama he had placed on the throne now returned to their rightful master.</p>
  
      <p>With devotion, he bowed. "My king, Ayodhya has awaited you."</p>
  
      <p>And at last, under the light of a thousand torches, Rama was crowned king.</p>
  
      <p>Rama Rajya had begun.</p>
  
      <p>Justice reigned. Peace flourished. Dharma was restored.</p>
  
      <p>Yet even in the light, shadows remained.</p>
  
      <p>For the burden of dharma is never light. And fate had one final trial yet to come.</p>
