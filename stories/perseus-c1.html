            <h2>The King’s Deceit</h2>
            <p><strong>The Price of Pride</strong></p>
            <p>On the island of Seriphos, young Perseus lived with his mother, Danaë, whose beauty caught the eye of King Polydectes—a man whose heart was as twisted as his ambition. Polydectes desired Danaë, but Perseus stood in his way, protective and unyielding, a barrier.</p>
            <p>Feigning friendship, Polydectes devised a cruel game. He announced he would marry another woman, inviting all the men of Seriphos to bring lavish gifts to honor the occasion. But Perseus, poor in gold yet rich in pride, had nothing to offer.</p>
            <p>Mocking the young man, Polydectes sneered, “Surely, a son of Zeus could bring me a finer gift than these petty trinkets. Perhaps… the head of Medusa, the dreaded Gorgon?”</p>
            <p>Laughter filled the hall, but Perseus’s face burned with shame—and defiance. “I will bring you her head,” he vowed, sealing his fate with words too bold to be taken back.</p>

            <h2>The Hero’s Pledge</h2>
            <p><strong>The Weight of an Impossible Quest</strong></p>
            <p>Perseus left Seriphos with nothing but his courage—and courage alone cannot slay a Gorgon. Medusa was no mere beast; she was a nightmare made flesh, her gaze turning men to stone, her hair a writhing nest of serpents, hissing with eternal hunger.</p>
            <p>But the gods were watching. Athena and Hermes appeared, offering Perseus the tools needed for his quest.</p>

            <h2>The Path of Shadows</h2>

            <p>To find Medusa, Perseus sought the Graeae, three ancient sisters who shared a single eye. Tricking them, he forced them to reveal Medusa’s lair and the relics he would need for his quest.</p>
