      <h2>Setup – The Weight of Karma (500 Years Under the Mountain)</h2>
      <p><strong>🔥 500 years of solitude. A second chance at destiny. The journey begins. 🏔️🐵✨</strong></p>
      <p>🌙 The night was silent.<br>
      Only the wind whispered through the valleys, rustling the leaves like ghostly echoes of forgotten battles.</p>
  
      <p>Beneath Five-Finger Mountain (五指山), Sun Wukong lay trapped.<br>
      🐵 The Great Sage, once defiant, now bound by fate.<br>
      🐵 His golden eyes, once filled with fire, now stared at an unchanging sky.</p>
  
      <p>💀 Time passed, but he did not change.<br>
      💨 Seasons turned—spring to summer, autumn to winter.<br>
      🌎 Kingdoms rose, empires fell.</p>
  
      <p>But the mountain did not move.<br>
      And Sun Wukong remained beneath it.</p>
  
      <p>He was no longer feared. No longer worshiped. No longer a threat to the heavens.</p>
  
      <p>Only a forgotten legend.</p>
  
      <p>For five centuries, he endured.<br>
      🌾 His only food—a few grains of rice from a passing deity.<br>
      💧 His only drink—drops of rain that slid through the cracks in the stone.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 He was unbreakable. But now, he was nothing.</p>
  
      <p>Until—</p>
  
      <p>👣 Footsteps.</p>
  
      <p>And with them, the whisper of fate.</p>

      <h2>Conflict – The Arrival of Tang Sanzang (Tripitaka)</h2>
      <p>🚶 A lone monk walked toward the mountain.<br>
      🌿 His robes were simple. His eyes were kind. His purpose—divine.</p>
  
      <p>This was Tang Sanzang (唐三藏).<br>
      A Buddhist monk on a pilgrimage to the West, tasked with retrieving the sacred scriptures from India.</p>
  
      <p>But he was not alone.</p>
  
      <p>Standing beside him, bathed in golden light, was Guanyin (观音菩萨), the Goddess of Mercy.</p>
  
      <p>✨ She turned to the trapped Monkey King.</p>
  
      <p>💮 "Sun Wukong, your time has come."</p>
  
      <p>🐵 His golden eyes flickered.<br>
      🔥 A spark of defiance still burned within him.</p>
  
      <p>⚡ "Have the heavens finally come to kill me?" he sneered.<br>
      ⚡ "Or have they realized they cannot?"</p>
  
      <p>🌸 Guanyin smiled.<br>
      💮 "The heavens do not wish to destroy you, Wukong. They wish to save you."</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "Save me?" he scoffed.<br>
      🐵 "I do not need saving. I need revenge."</p>
  
      <p>🌙 Guanyin shook her head.</p>
  
      <p>💮 "You sought to rule Heaven, but instead, you were bound by it. Tell me, Great Sage—did your strength free you?"</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Sun Wukong fell silent.</p>
  
      <p>💮 "Your chains are not of stone, but of your own heart. If you wish to be free, serve this monk on his journey to the West."</p>
  
      <p>🚶 Tang Sanzang stepped forward.<br>
      🌿 His voice was gentle, yet unwavering.</p>
  
      <p>🙏 "If you protect me on my journey, I shall free you."</p>
  
      <p>The mountain rumbled.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Sun Wukong felt something shift.</p>
  
      <p>💀 For the first time in five hundred years, the weight upon his body began to lift.</p>
  
      <p>The seal on the mountain faded.</p>
  
      <p>And in a blinding flash of golden light—</p>
  
      <p>🏔️ Sun Wukong was free.</p>
  
      <p>🔥 The Great Sage had returned. 🔥</p>

      <h2>Resolution – The Golden Headband & First Test of Obedience</h2>
  
      <p>Sun Wukong stretched his limbs, feeling power surge through him once more.<br>
      ⚡ Lightning crackled in his veins.<br>
      ⚡ The sky itself seemed to tremble.</p>
  
      <p>He turned to Tang Sanzang, smirking.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "So, Master, where do we begin? Shall I carve a path through mountains? Strike down gods?"</p>
  
      <p>🌿 Tang Sanzang simply smiled.</p>
  
      <p>🚶 "We begin with discipline."</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Sun Wukong frowned.<br>
      🐵 "Discipline?"</p>
  
      <p>✨ Guanyin raised her hand, and in her palm lay a simple golden circlet.</p>
  
      <p>💮 "This is the Golden Headband (金箍咒)."</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Sun Wukong scoffed.<br>
      🐵 "A crown? You honor me already!"</p>
  
      <p>👑 He placed it upon his head—and instantly regretted it.</p>
  
      <p>🌩️ A searing pain struck through his skull.<br>
      🔥 Fire burned through his mind.<br>
      ⚡ His strength meant nothing against it.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 He roared in agony.</p>
  
      <p>💮 Guanyin’s voice was calm.</p>
  
      <p>💮 "This is no gift, Sun Wukong. It is your test."</p>
  
      <p>🔥 Sun Wukong fell to his knees.<br>
      🔥 His hands clawed at the headband, but it would not move.</p>
  
      <p>🌿 Tang Sanzang spoke a single word.</p>
  
      <p>🙏 "Obey."</p>
  
      <p>⚡ The pain ceased.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Sun Wukong gasped, trembling.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "You… you can control me?"</p>
  
      <p>🚶 Tang Sanzang nodded.</p>
  
      <p>🙏 "Not control. Guide."</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Sun Wukong glared.<br>
      🐵 "You think I will serve you?"</p>
  
      <p>🌸 Guanyin smiled.</p>
  
      <p>💮 "That is up to you, Great Sage."</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Sun Wukong clenched his fists.</p>
  
      <p>🔥 For the first time in his existence, he was not fighting against chains.<br>
      🔥 He was choosing whether or not to wear them.</p>
  
      <p>He turned to Tang Sanzang.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "I will travel with you, Master."<br>
      🐵 "But do not think I have changed."</p>
  
      <p>🚶 Tang Sanzang simply smiled.</p>
  
      <p>🌿 "Then let us begin."</p>
  
      <p>☀️ And so, the Journey to the West began. ☀️</p>
