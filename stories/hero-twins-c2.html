      <h2>Setup – The Summons to Xibalba</h2>
      <p><strong>The Lords of Death Call the Twins</strong></p>
  
      <p>Time passed, and Hunahpu and Xbalanque grew into clever, fearless tricksters. They spent their days playing ball, their laughter echoing through the land.</p>
  
      <p>But the sound reached beyond the mortal world.</p>
  
      <p>Deep within Xibalba, One Death and Seven Death heard the echoes of the past—the game they thought they had ended.</p>
  
      <p>"They sound like their fathers," One Death growled.</p>
  
      <p>"They will share their fathers’ fate," Seven Death hissed.</p>
  
      <p>Messengers of Xibalba climbed from the underworld, carrying an invitation wrapped in false honor.</p>
  
      <p>"The Lords of Xibalba request your presence in their court," they declared.</p>
  
      <p>The twins exchanged a glance. They knew this was no mere invitation—this was a trap.</p>
  
      <p>Yet they did not hesitate.</p>
  
      <p>"We accept."</p>
  
      <p>For they were not their fathers.</p>
  
      <p>They would play the game.</p>
  
      <p>But they would not be the ones to lose.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>Conflict – The Journey & Deadly Trials</h2>
      <p><strong>The Road to the Underworld</strong></p>
  
      <p>The path to Xibalba was long and treacherous. Rivers of blood and pus blocked the way, their waters writhing with unseen horrors.</p>
  
      <p>The twins, however, stepped across them as if they were mere puddles—unshaken, untouched.</p>
  
      <p>At last, they arrived before the throne of the Lords of Death.</p>
  
      <p>"Welcome," One Death sneered.</p>
  
      <p>"We have prepared trials for you," Seven Death said, grinning.</p>
  
      <p>The trials of Xibalba had broken the first Hero Twins.</p>
  
      <p>But Hunahpu and Xbalanque were no ordinary challengers.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Trial 1 – The Dark House</strong></p>
      <p>The twins were sent into a house of endless blackness, meant to disorient and terrify them.</p>
  
      <p>They laughed.</p>
  
      <p>Instead of fumbling in the darkness, they simply stayed still until dawn, outwitting the trial without effort.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Trial 2 – The Razor House</strong></p>
      <p>A room filled with blades that moved on their own, sharp as obsidian.</p>
  
      <p>The twins spoke to the blades as if they were living things.</p>
  
      <p>"Be still," they whispered.</p>
  
      <p>And so the blades did not move.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Trial 3 – The Jaguar House</strong></p>
      <p>The next house was filled with jaguars, their golden eyes glowing in the dark.</p>
  
      <p>Instead of running, the twins tossed bones into the air, distracting the beasts until sunrise.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Trial 4 – The Fire House</strong></p>
      <p>Flames rose around them, consuming everything.</p>
  
      <p>But the twins remained untouched, for they had learned to dance within the flames.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Trial 5 – The Bat House (Camazotz’s Domain)</strong></p>
      <p>This house was different.</p>
  
      <p>It was the dwelling of Camazotz, the bat god—a creature of death, a shadow of the night itself.</p>
  
      <p>The twins lay still, hidden within their blowguns, waiting for morning.</p>
  
      <p>But in the darkness, Camazotz stirred.</p>
  
      <p>Without warning, the bat swooped down.</p>
  
      <p>And with a single stroke of his claws—he took Hunahpu’s head.</p>

      <h2>Resolution – The Defeat of Camazotz & The Twin’s Triumph</h2>
      <p><strong>A Trick Against Death Itself</strong></p>
  
      <p>For the first time, Xbalanque stood alone.</p>
  
      <p>His brother’s headless body lay beside him, silent.</p>
  
      <p>The Lords of Xibalba laughed in triumph.</p>
  
      <p>"They have lost," they said.</p>
  
      <p>But Xbalanque only smiled.</p>
  
      <p>In the morning, the bats carried Hunahpu’s head to the court of Xibalba, placing it upon the ballcourt as the new game ball.</p>
  
      <p>The Lords cheered. "Let us play," they declared.</p>
  
      <p>But they had already lost.</p>
  
      <p>As the game began, Xbalanque called to the animals of the land, gathering the creatures of the earth.</p>
  
      <p>With their help, he crafted a new head for Hunahpu, binding his soul back into flesh.</p>
  
      <p>And as the game reached its peak—Hunahpu stood up, whole once more.</p>
  
      <p>The Lords of Xibalba froze in terror.</p>
  
      <p>The twins had done what no mortal had ever done before.</p>
  
      <p>They had defied death itself.</p>
  
      <p>And the game was not over.</p>
  
      <p>Not yet.</p>
