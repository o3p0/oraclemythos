      <h2>Setup â€“ The Goddess & the Omen</h2>
      <p><strong>A Birth Foretold</strong></p>
      <p>Atop Coatepec, the Serpent Mountain, dwelled Coatlicueâ€”Mother of the Gods, She Who Wears the Serpent Skirt.</p>
      <p>Her form was terrible yet divineâ€”a skirt woven of snakes, her hands clawed, her neck adorned with severed hands and hearts.</p>
      <p>She was life and death, the giver of birth, the devourer of flesh.</p>
      <p>One day, as she swept the sacred temple, she saw something strangeâ€”</p>
      <p>A ball of feathers drifted from the heavens, landing gently upon the ground.</p>
      <p>Drawn by its beauty, she picked it up and placed it against her chest.</p>
      <p>When she looked againâ€”the feathers were gone.</p>
      <p>And at that moment, she felt something stir within her.</p>
      <p>She had become pregnant.</p>
      <p>The gods whispered. The earth trembled. A child of fire was forming in her womb.</p>
      <p>But not all would rejoice at this birth.</p>

      <h2>Conflict â€“ The Daughterâ€™s Wrath</h2>
      <p><strong>A Familyâ€™s Betrayal</strong></p>
      <p>Far away, Coyolxauhqui, the Moon Goddess, heard the news.</p>
      <p>She, the eldest daughter, the golden-belled warrior, was enraged.</p>
      <p>"Mother, you have shamed us!" she cried. "Who is the father of this child?"</p>
      <p>But Coatlicue gave no answer.</p>
      <p>Coyolxauhquiâ€™s heart burned with fury and fear.</p>
      <p>"This is no natural child," she told her 400 brothers, the Centzon Huitznahua, the stars. "This thing inside her will bring ruin upon us all!"</p>
      <p>The stars listened, their hands gripping their obsidian blades.</p>
      <p>"She has betrayed us," they agreed. "We must kill her before this child is born."</p>
      <p>Coyolxauhqui led them forth, marching toward Coatepec, ready to spill their motherâ€™s blood.</p>

      <h2>Resolution â€“ The Unseen Protector</h2>
      <p><strong>The Child Who Waits</strong></p>
      <p>Coatlicue stood alone atop the sacred mountain.</p>
      <p>She could see her children comingâ€”their spears gleaming, their faces twisted with rage.</p>
      <p>She wept.</p>
      <p>"If my own children wish my death, then so be it," she whispered.</p>
      <p>But in the darkness of her womb, something listened.</p>
      <p>A voice, silent yet strong.</p>
      <p>"Do not fear, Mother," it said. "I am ready."</p>
      <p>For within Coatlicue, a god was waiting.</p>
      <p>Not weak.<br>Not afraid.<br>But fully armed.</p>
      <p>And when the moment cameâ€”when the first blade was raised against his motherâ€”</p>
      <p>ðŸ”¥ Huitzilopochtli would rise. ðŸ”¥</p>
