      <h2>The King Faces His Greatest Trial</h2>
      <p><strong>The Divine Order Restored ‚Äì Oranmiyan‚Äôs Legacy</strong></p>
  
      <p>üî• The final test. The last lesson. The dawn of a new age. üî•</p>
  
      <p>The heavens were silent, yet the Orishas watched. Oranmiyan, crowned as the first king of Ile-Ife, stood upon the sacred hill, gazing at the vast land before him. His people rejoiced, the drums of celebration echoing through the valleys.</p>
  
      <p>But in the shadows, unrest brewed.</p>
  
      <p>A group of warriors, led by a rival chief, challenged his rule. ‚ÄúThe gods have no place among men!‚Äù they declared. ‚ÄúA king must be chosen by warriors, not spirits!‚Äù</p>
  
      <p>Oranmiyan tightened his grip on his iron staff. He had proven his worth to the Orishas, but now, he had to prove it to men.</p>
  
      <p>Would power alone secure his throne? Or was there another way?</p>

      <h2>The Choice of a True King</h2>
      <p><strong>The Choice of a True King</strong></p>
  
      <p>The warriors approached, their blades gleaming in the sun. The people of Ile-Ife held their breath‚Äîwould Oranmiyan crush them with divine strength, as Ogun would?</p>
  
      <p>Oranmiyan raised his hand. ‚ÄúI do not rule by force,‚Äù he declared. ‚ÄúA king is not a warlord, nor a god. He is the bridge between heaven and earth.‚Äù</p>
  
      <p>He knelt and placed his iron staff in the ground. ‚ÄúIf my rule is just, let the land itself bear witness.‚Äù</p>
  
      <p>At that moment, the earth trembled. From where his staff touched the ground, a great tree sprang forth‚Äîits roots stretching deep into Ile-Ife, its branches reaching toward the sky.</p>
  
      <p>The warriors fell silent. The Orishas had spoken. Oranmiyan had passed his final trial.</p>

      <h2>The Dawn of a New Age</h2>
      <p><strong>The Dawn of a New Age</strong></p>
  
      <p>The rival chief knelt before him. ‚ÄúForgive us, King of Ife. We have seen your truth.‚Äù</p>
  
      <p>Oranmiyan helped him rise. ‚ÄúNo king rules alone,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJoin me, and together we will build a kingdom that will never fall.‚Äù</p>
  
      <p>The people of Ile-Ife cheered, and from that day forward, Oranmiyan‚Äôs name was spoken with reverence. He had not won through bloodshed, but through wisdom and honor.</p>
  
      <p>From his line, great kings would arise. His kingdom would become the heart of Yoruba civilization.</p>
  
      <p>And though ages would pass, the sacred tree he planted remained, a symbol of the balance between gods and men.</p>
  
      <p>The Orishas watched and were pleased. The divine order was restored.</p>
  
      <p>But history is never truly finished. Every king must face his own trials, and the gods will always watch.</p>
