      <h2>The Orishasâ€™ Final Judgment</h2>
      <p><strong>Chapter 9 â€“ The Final Trial of Sango âš¡</strong></p>
  
      <p>The storm had passed. The flames had dimmed. Sango stood in the ruins of their battlefield, his breath heavy, his heart racing. Across from him, Ogun lowered his iron blade, nodding in approval.</p>
  
      <p>"You have strength, Sango," Ogun said, his voice deep like the beating of a war drum. "But strength alone does not make a king."</p>
  
      <p>Above them, the sky darkened againâ€”not with storm clouds, but with the presence of the Orishas. Olodumare, the Supreme God, had arrived. With him stood Obatala, Orunmila, and Oya, the goddess of winds and change.</p>
  
      <p>"Sango," Olodumareâ€™s voice rumbled like distant thunder. "Your path nears its end. One final trial remains."</p>
  
      <p>The ground beneath Sango trembled. The air crackled with divine energy. This was not a test of strength. This was a test of who he would become.</p>
  
      <p>Would he rise as a ruler? Or fall as a warrior consumed by his own fire?</p>

      <h2>The Trial of Fire and Judgment</h2>
      <p><strong>The Trial of Fire and Judgment</strong></p>
  
      <p>The Orishas raised their hands, and the land shifted. Sango found himself standing atop a high mountain, overlooking the vast kingdom below. Villages burned in the distance. The people cried out.</p>
  
      <p>He turnedâ€”and saw his own reflection in the storm clouds. His own power had done this. His own rage.</p>
  
      <p>Then, he saw them. His enemies. The men who had defied him. The rulers who had mocked him. His hands burned with fire, his soul demanded vengeance.</p>
  
      <p><em>Strike them down.</em></p>
  
      <p>The voice was not his own, but it echoed within him. The flames in his hands grew. The sky raged with lightning. This was the power he had always wanted. This was his right.</p>
  
      <p>But thenâ€”he saw Oya, standing at the edge of the storm. Her eyes were knowing, her expression unreadable.</p>
  
      <p>"Sango," she whispered, "will you rule with fire? Or will you command the storm?"</p>
  
      <p>The words struck him. Fire consumed. Fire destroyed. But the stormâ€¦ the storm was power without ruin. Lightning struck, but the rain restored.</p>
  
      <p>Sango closed his hands. The fire dimmed.</p>
  
      <p>"I will not burn my kingdom to the ground," he said, his voice steady. "I will be the storm that protects it."</p>
  
      <p>At that moment, the trial ended. The flames vanished. The land was whole. The storm settled. And the Orishas smiled.</p>

      <h2>The Rise of the Thunder King</h2>
      <p><strong>The Rise of the Thunder King</strong></p>
  
      <p>Olodumareâ€™s voice echoed through the heavens.</p>
  
      <p>"You have chosen wisely, Sango. Fire alone does not rule. But the storm? The storm commands the world."</p>
  
      <p>Ogun stepped forward, placing his iron blade at Sangoâ€™s feet. "You have earned my respect, brother," he said. "May your lightning forge a new path for our people."</p>
  
      <p>Oya approached next, placing her hands on Sangoâ€™s shoulders. "The winds shall carry your name across the land. You are no longer just a warrior, Sango. You are Orisha."</p>
  
      <p>The skies roared with thunder. The people below lifted their faces to the heavens. The name Sango was whispered across the kingdom. Not as a warrior. Not as a conqueror.</p>
  
      <p>But as a king.</p>
  
      <p>And so, the legend of the Thunder God was born. âš¡ðŸ”¥</p>
