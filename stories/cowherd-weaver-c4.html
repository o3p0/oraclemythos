      <h2>The Eternal Sorrow of the Stars</h2>
      <p><strong>Two Lovers Divided by the Celestial River</strong></p>
      <p>The heavens were silent.</p>
      <p>On one side of the Celestial River, Zhinü (织女) sat alone, weaving endlessly. On the other, Niulang (牛郎) stood, watching her from across the vast expanse of stars.</p>
      <p>Night after night, they reached toward one another—but the river never faded.</p>
      <p>🔥 Altair and Vega, the two brightest stars, now burned with longing. 🔥</p>
      <p>And below, the world wept with them.</p>
      <p>The mortals, seeing their sorrow, prayed:</p>
      <p>"Is there no way for love to triumph over fate?"</p>
      <p>And the gods listened.</p>

      <h2>The Magpies’ Gift</h2>
      <p><strong>The Birds That Defied the Heavens</strong></p>
      <p>As the seasons passed, the sky watched, unchanging.</p>
      <p>But one night, beneath the seventh moon, a stirring filled the air.</p>
      <p>The magpies (喜鹊)—creatures of loyalty and devotion—took flight.</p>
      <p>Thousands rose from the earth, their wings shimmering like silver threads.</p>
      <p>They soared toward the heavens, their cries echoing across the night.</p>
      <p>And when they reached the Celestial River, they did not stop.</p>
      <p>🌌 They gathered, forming a bridge of feathers, stretching from one shore to the other.</p>
      <p>For the first time since the river was created, there was a path across.</p>
      <p>The gods, seeing the magpies' devotion, made a decree—</p>
      <p>🔥 "Once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, you may meet again." 🔥</p>
      <p>For one night only, love would overcome fate.</p>

      <h2>The Qixi Festival & The Lovers’ Reunion</h2>
      <p><strong>A Night of Rain & Love</strong></p>
      <p>On the seventh night of the seventh moon, the lovers met.</p>
      <p>✨ Niulang took Zhinü’s hands.<br>✨ Zhinü wept into his shoulder.<br>✨ The stars burned brighter than ever before.</p>
      <p>The world below felt their joy, and on that night, the rain began to fall.</p>
      <p>🌧️ It was not a storm, but their tears—falling to the earth in a lover’s embrace. 🌧️</p>
      <p>From that day forward, the Qixi Festival (七夕节) was born.</p>
      <p>Each year, lovers look to the sky, watching for Altair and Vega, waiting for the moment when—just for a night—</p>
      <p>💫 The Celestial River fades…<br>💫 The magpies return…<br>💫 And love, even against fate, finds its way home.</p>
      <p><em>—The End.</em></p>
