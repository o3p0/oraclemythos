      <h2>The Call to Adventure</h2>
      <p><strong>The Dying Guardian</strong></p>
  
      <p>The forest lay silent. A trail of broken branches and disturbed earth marked Ravana’s path, but Sita was gone, lost beyond the horizon.</p>
  
      <p>Rama and Lakshmana followed the signs, their hearts heavy with dread. Then—a voice, faint as the wind.</p>
  
      <p>Jatayu, the great eagle, lay in the dirt, his mighty wings torn, his lifeblood soaking the earth. With fading breath, he spoke:</p>
  
      <p>"Rama… I fought… but could not stop him. The demon king… has taken Sita to Lanka."</p>
  
      <p>His duty fulfilled, Jatayu closed his eyes. His spirit soared beyond mortal pain, rising toward the heavens, where the gods welcomed him as a warrior of dharma.</p>
  
      <p>Rama knelt beside him, grief shadowing his face. "You have done more than any could ask, noble Jatayu. May you find peace in the realm of the righteous."</p>
  
      <p>The time for mourning was brief. Sita was in Lanka. And the path to her rescue was set.</p>

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p><strong>The Monkey King’s Oath</strong></p>
  
      <p>Guided by the wisdom of Shabari, a devout ascetic, Rama and Lakshmana journeyed south, where the vanara kingdom of Kishkindha lay hidden among the mountains.</p>
  
      <p>There, they met Hanuman, whose eyes shone with divine recognition. "You are Vishnu’s incarnation," he said, bowing before Rama. "We have awaited your arrival, my lord."</p>
  
      <p>Hanuman led them to Sugriva, the exiled monkey king. Betrayed by his brother Vali, Sugriva sought revenge and a way to reclaim his throne.</p>
  
      <p>A pact was made—Rama would help Sugriva defeat Vali, and in return, Sugriva would aid in the search for Sita.</p>
  
      <p>When the time came, Rama struck Vali down with a single arrow, restoring Sugriva’s rule. True to his word, Sugriva summoned his armies of vanaras, sending them to search the ends of the earth for Sita.</p>
  
      <p>It was Hanuman who found the answer.</p>
  
      <p>Blessed with divine strength, he leapt across the vast ocean to Lanka, where Ravana’s stronghold rose like a black mountain. Hidden among the shadows, he found Ashoka Vatika, a sacred grove where Sita sat in sorrow.</p>
  
      <p>"Rama lives," Hanuman whispered as he approached her. "He will come for you."</p>
  
      <p>Tears filled Sita’s eyes, but her spirit remained unbroken. "Tell him I wait, unwavering. Tell him I am his, now and always."</p>
  
      <p>Before he could leave, Hanuman’s presence was discovered. Demons swarmed him, but he fought like a storm—crushing warriors, uprooting trees, shaking the very foundations of Lanka.</p>
  
      <p>Captured at last, he was dragged before Ravana, bound in iron. The demon king’s eyes burned with fury.</p>
  
      <p>"You dare defy me?"</p>
  
      <p>Hanuman only laughed. "You have sealed your fate, Ravana. The gods watch, and dharma will not be denied."</p>
  
      <p>Enraged, Ravana ordered his tail set aflame, a cruel spectacle for his court. But Hanuman, unshaken, broke free of his bonds, leapt skyward, and set Lanka ablaze.</p>
  
      <p>The city burned. And as Hanuman soared back across the ocean, the night was lit with Ravana’s fury.</p>

      <h2>The Payoff</h2>
      <p><strong>The Bridge of Destiny</strong></p>
  
      <p>Hanuman returned to Rama, delivering Sita’s message and confirming her location.</p>
  
      <p>There was no time to waste. The vanara army assembled at the shores of the great sea, staring across the waters to the distant island of Lanka.</p>
  
      <p>How would they cross?</p>
  
      <p>Rama knelt in prayer. The ocean trembled. And then—the gods answered.</p>
  
      <p>Stone upon stone, the Rama Setu took shape, a bridge rising from the depths, forged by faith and the hands of thousands.</p>
  
      <p>As the army marched toward Lanka, the skies darkened. The storm of destiny had arrived.</p>
  
      <p>And in Lanka, Ravana prepared. His warriors stood ready, his sorcerers whispered spells. The battle for dharma was at hand.</p>
  
      <p>The final war had begun.</p>
