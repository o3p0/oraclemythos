      <h2>The First Mortal King is Chosen</h2>
      <p><strong>The Birth of Kings – Oranmiyan’s Rise to Power</strong></p>
  
      <p>The earth had been shaped. The rivers had carved their paths. The sky stretched endlessly above, and the land of Ile-Ife had flourished under the watchful eyes of the Orishas. But there was one final task: who would rule the mortal world?</p>
  
      <p>The gods had walked among men, guiding them, teaching them. But humans were growing—multiplying, spreading. They needed a leader of their own, a bridge between heaven and earth.</p>
  
      <p>Orunmila, the god of wisdom, spoke before the gathered Orishas.</p>
  
      <p>“The time has come. The world is young, but it must not be lawless. One shall rise among men to lead, to shape kingdoms, and to ensure that Olodumare’s will is upheld.”</p>
  
      <p>But who could bear such a responsibility?</p>
  
      <p>Then, from the divine halls, a figure stepped forward—one who carried both divine blood and human strength. His name was Oranmiyan, the son of Ogun, the god of iron, and a mortal woman of Ile-Ife. He was born of gods, yet raised among men, fierce in battle yet wise in heart.</p>
  
      <p>The Orishas watched as Oranmiyan knelt before them. His hands gripped a spear of iron, forged in his father’s fire. His eyes burned with purpose.</p>
  
      <p>“Give me the weight of kingship,” he said. “I will rule not with fear, but with justice. I will honor the gods, yet stand among men.”</p>
  
      <p>The Orishas murmured, watching him with curiosity. Could a being of both realms truly rule?</p>
  
      <p>Obatala, the creator of mankind, stepped forward. “Then let the gods decide,” he said. “You will be tested, Oranmiyan. If you prevail, the throne of Ile-Ife shall be yours.”</p>

      <h2>The Trial of Oranmiyan</h2>
      <p><strong>The Trial of Oranmiyan</strong></p>
  
      <p>To prove himself worthy, Oranmiyan was given three trials, each one testing the virtues of a true ruler:</p>
  
      <p>🔹 The Trial of Strength – He was sent to tame the wild beasts of the earth, for a king must protect his people from chaos. Oranmiyan entered the deep forests of Ile-Ife, where the great leopards roamed. He faced them not with weapons, but with courage, and they bowed before his might.</p>
  
      <p>🔹 The Trial of Wisdom – He was given a riddle by Orunmila himself: “What is the greatest gift a ruler can give his people?” Many answered with power, wealth, or protection. But Oranmiyan answered, “Justice. Without it, power is cruel. Wealth is empty. Strength is wasted.” And so, Orunmila nodded in approval.</p>
  
      <p>🔹 The Trial of Honor – He was asked to choose between divine favor and the needs of his people. Given the chance to claim immortality, he refused. “A king must live and die among his people,” he declared. “Let me reign as a man, not a god.”</p>
  
      <p>At last, the trials were complete. The gods had seen enough.</p>
  
      <p>Obatala smiled, Orunmila nodded, and Ogun—the father of Oranmiyan—stood with pride.</p>
  
      <p>“You have proven yourself,” they declared. “Rise, Oranmiyan. You shall be the first king of men, the one who unites them under the wisdom of the gods.”</p>

    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>The Dawn of Kingship</h2>
      <p><strong>The Dawn of Kingship</strong></p>
  
      <p>The Orishas gathered at the sacred hills of Ile-Ife, where the first land had been formed from the sea. There, Oranmiyan was crowned in the presence of the gods, a moment never before seen in creation.</p>
  
      <p>Obatala placed a crown of white cloth upon his head.</p>
  
      <p>Ogun gave him a staff of iron, a symbol of strength and rule.</p>
  
      <p>Orunmila whispered a prophecy: “The kings that follow you shall rise and fall, but your name will never be forgotten.”</p>
  
      <p>And so, the first mortal ruler of Ile-Ife was born—the beginning of the great Yoruba kingship.</p>
  
      <p>But as Oranmiyan took his throne, a shadow loomed in the distance. The gods had shaped the world, but mankind had only just begun its journey. Would the balance between divine and mortal last forever?</p>
  
      <p><em>The final chapter awaits.</em></p>
