            <h2>The Beast Born of Chaos</h2>
            <p><strong>"The wolf grows with every heartbeat, his hunger boundless, his shadow stretching long before him."</strong></p>
            <p>Beneath the boughs of Yggdrasil, where the roots drink from wells of fate and decay, the gods of Asgard gathered in uneasy council. Odin’s words from his dark vision echoed in their minds—the prophecy of Ragnarök, the twilight of the gods. Central to this doom was a name whispered with fear: Fenrir.</p>
            <p>Born of chaos, Fenrir was the monstrous wolf, son of the trickster god Loki and the giantess Angrboda. From the moment of his birth, the gods sensed his destiny: a beast fated to kill Odin, devour the sun, and drown the world in shadow.</p>
            <p>Yet, when Fenrir was young, the gods had not feared him—not fully. He had been raised among them in Asgard, his fangs small, his eyes bright with curiosity. Only Týr, the god of war and honor, showed him kindness, feeding him, training him, and watching as the wolf grew—faster, stronger, hungrier.</p>
            <p>But Fenrir’s growth was unnatural. With each passing day, his jaws could crush stone, his breath carried the chill of death, and his golden eyes gleamed with a fury that no chain could hold. The gods knew: they could not wait for the prophecy to fulfill itself. They had to act.</p>

            <h2>The Chains of Deceit</h2>
            <p><strong>"The gods fear what they cannot control. And what they fear, they seek to bind."</strong></p>
            <p>The gods devised a plan—not with swords or spears, but with deception. They approached Fenrir with laughter in their voices and lies in their hearts.</p>
            <p>“We’ve forged a new chain,” they said, “one that no creature can break. But surely, a wolf as strong as you can prove us wrong.”</p>
            <p>Fenrir, prideful and sharp of mind, sensed the treachery beneath their words. He snarled, his voice deep as winter storms: "If this is but a game, let one of you place their hand in my jaws as a pledge of good faith."</p>
            <p>Silence fell. None stepped forward—save Týr. The god who had fed Fenrir when others cowered. The god who had once called him friend. Without a word, Týr placed his hand between the wolf’s crushing teeth.</p>
            <p>The gods wrapped the chain—Gleipnir, a silken ribbon forged by dwarves from impossible things. It seemed delicate, harmless. But as they tightened it, Fenrir felt its strength.</p>
            <p>He thrashed. He roared. He fought with all the fury of the wild. But the chain held.</p>
            <p>Realizing the betrayal, Fenrir’s rage became absolute. His jaws snapped shut, severing Týr’s hand at the wrist. The god did not scream.</p>

            <h2>The Wolf’s Curse</h2>
            <p><strong>"You may bind me, but you cannot escape me."</strong></p>
            <p>Bound and betrayed, Fenrir thrashed against Gleipnir, but the chain held firm. The gods drove a sword into his jaws, forcing them open, leaving him gagging in eternal silence, his saliva spilling into rivers of venom.</p>
            <p>But prophecy does not die with chains. The gods had delayed their doom, not destroyed it. Fenrir’s eyes burned with a promise: "I will break free. I will devour the sun. I will kill the Allfather. And when I rise again, your blood will feed the roots of Yggdrasil."</p>
            <p>—To be continued in Chapter 4: The Death of Baldr.</p>
