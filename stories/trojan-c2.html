            <h2>The Queen of Sparta</h2>
            <p>Across the Aegean Sea, in the kingdom of Sparta, Queen Helen lived as the jewel of Greece—the face that could launch a thousand ships. Born of divine beauty, the daughter of Zeus and Leda, she was both mortal and more than mortal, her radiance unmatched.</p>
            <p>Helen was married to Menelaus, king of Sparta—a man of power, but not of charm. Their union was a treaty, a political alliance rather than a love story.</p>
            <p>Into this fragile balance stepped Paris, prince of Troy, guided by Aphrodite’s promise. As an ambassador, he was welcomed into Menelaus’ court, treated as an honored guest under the sacred laws of <em>xenia</em>—hospitality.</p>
            <p>But the gods had already written a different story.</p>
            <p>Helen’s gaze met Paris’, and the world grew quiet. Whether it was Aphrodite’s enchantment or a spark of forbidden desire, something ancient stirred.</p>

            <h2>When Desire Defies Duty</h2>
            <p>Fate moved swiftly. Menelaus was called away to Crete, leaving Paris under Helen’s roof. In his absence, the seeds sown by Aphrodite bloomed.</p>
            <p>Paris whispered of freedom, passion, and destiny, his words sweet as honey and sharp as a dagger. Helen, torn between duty and desire, listened. Some say Aphrodite clouded her mind, others that her heart had long been restless.</p>
            <p>One night, beneath the veil of darkness, Helen made her choice. She left Sparta—her throne, her daughter, her vows—and sailed with Paris to Troy, cradled by Aphrodite’s favor and the promise of a new life.</p>
            <p>But the gods do not offer gifts without cost.</p>
            <p>When Menelaus returned to find his wife gone, rage filled the void where love had been. It was not just a personal betrayal—it was an affront to his honor, to the sacred laws of hospitality.</p>
            <p>This was not a crime to be forgiven. It was an insult to be avenged.</p>

            <h2>The War Begins</h2>
            <p><strong>The Oath of Blood</strong></p>
            <p>Menelaus did not suffer alone. Years before, when Helen’s beauty drew suitors from every corner of Greece, her father made them swear a sacred oath:</p>
            <p><em>“Whoever wins Helen’s hand shall have the protection of all her suitors. If ever she is taken, they will unite to bring her back—no matter the cost.”</em></p>
            <p>Now, Menelaus called upon that oath. His brother, Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, answered. So did kings and heroes across Greece:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Odysseus</strong>, the cunning mind of Ithaca.</li>
                <li><strong>Ajax</strong>, the towering warrior.</li>
                <li><strong>Nestor</strong>, the wise elder.</li>
                <li><strong>Achilles</strong>, fated to die young but remembered forever.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Together, they gathered a force unlike any the world had seen. A thousand ships filled with warriors, bound by honor, rage, and the thirst for glory.</p>
            <p>The winds carried them toward Troy.</p>
