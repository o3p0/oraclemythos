      <h2>Setup â€“ The Call to Creation</h2>
      <p><strong>The Divine Mission Begins</strong></p>
  
      <p>In the vast expanse of Orun, the celestial realm beyond mortal reach, Olodumare, the Supreme God, gazed upon the formless abyss below. The world had not yet taken shapeâ€”only endless waters stretched across the void, restless and unclaimed.</p>
  
      <p>Olodumare, who held the power of all creation, knew the time had come to bring forth the earth. But divine order required that the task be entrusted to one of the Orishas, the powerful deities who shaped the cosmos under his will.</p>
  
      <p>Summoning Obatala, the god of purity and wisdom, Olodumare spoke:</p>
  
      <p>"The world must be made. Obatala, you will descend from Orun and give it form. You will be the sculptor of the earth and the father of humanity."</p>
  
      <p>Obatala, honored yet solemn, bowed deeply. "I shall carry out your will, Great Olodumare. The land shall rise, and life shall flourish."</p>
  
      <p>But creation was not a simple task. Olodumare called forth Orunmila, the god of wisdom and destiny, to guide Obatala on this sacred mission. Orunmila, whose sight pierced through time itself, provided the tools of creation:</p>
  
      <p>ðŸ”¹ A golden chain â€“ to descend from the heavens.<br>
      ðŸ”¹ A gourd filled with sacred sand â€“ to form the land.<br>
      ðŸ”¹ A white hen â€“ to scatter the sand and shape the earth.<br>
      ðŸ”¹ A sacred palm nut â€“ to bring forth the first trees.</p>
  
      <p>"Go, Obatala," Olodumare decreed. "Let the world take shape."</p>
  
      <p>And with that, the journey of creation began.</p>

      <h2>Conflict & Action â€“ The Descent to Chaos</h2>
      <p><strong>The Descent to Chaos</strong></p>
  
      <p>Obatala grasped the golden chain and lowered himself from the heavens, descending toward the endless waters below. With each step downward, the air grew thick, the darkness vast. He could hear the whispers of the deep, the restless currents that had never known land.</p>
  
      <p>The chain reached its final link, swaying above the boundless abyss. Below, the waters churned, untamed and wild. Obatala unfastened the gourd tied to his waist and carefully poured its contents.</p>
  
      <p>A soft cascade of white sand drifted downward, vanishing into the waters. And thenâ€”something miraculous.</p>
  
      <p>The sea began to still. Where the sand touched, the waters parted, and a new surface emerged. A tiny mound, rising from the deep, like a breath taken after eons of silence.</p>
  
      <p>Then, Obatala released the white hen. It fluttered to the ground, pecking and scratching, scattering the sand further in all directions. The land stretched outward, growing wider, stronger, until it became a vast expanse.</p>
  
      <p>The first earth was formed.</p>
  
      <p>Obatala stepped onto the newborn land and declared, "This place shall be called Ile-Ife, the sacred cradle of the world."</p>

      <h2>Resolution & Cliffhanger â€“ The Land Takes Shape</h2>
      <p><strong>The Land Takes Shape</strong></p>
  
      <p>As Obatala stood upon the firm ground, he planted the sacred palm nut into the soil. Within moments, the first tree sprouted, stretching toward the sky. From it, other trees would grow, their roots binding the land together.</p>
  
      <p>The world had begun. But his work was far from over.</p>
  
      <p>"I have shaped the land," Obatala murmured, looking across the vast empty plains. "But now, I must give it life."</p>
  
      <p>His heart swelled with purposeâ€”he would sculpt humanity itself. Yet unseen forces stirred in the distance, and fate had already set its course.</p>
  
      <p>The task was not yet complete. And soon, a choice would be made that would change everything.</p>
