      <h2>Setup – The Deception of the Asuras</h2>
      <p><strong>The Battle for Immortality</strong></p>
  
      <p>The Amrita was theirs.</p>
  
      <p>The Asuras, their eyes burning with victory, clutched the golden pot of nectar. The churning had been arduous, but now, at last, immortality was within their grasp.</p>
  
      <p>The Devas stood helpless, watching their one chance to regain power slip away. Indra’s fists clenched. Had they come this far only to be defeated by treachery?</p>
  
      <p>Far above, Vishnu remained still. He had foreseen this moment. The Asuras, in their greed, had overreached. Now, it was time for the final act of his grand design.</p>
  
      <p>With a thought, he transformed.</p>
  
      <p>The air shimmered, the very fabric of reality bending—until a figure of unparalleled beauty emerged.</p>
  
      <p>A woman, radiant as the dawn, her form swaying like the waves, her presence an enchantment beyond mortal desire.</p>
  
      <p>She was Mohini—the celestial enchantress.</p>
  
      <p>The Asuras turned as one. Their laughter died. The pot of nectar hung forgotten in their hands.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>Conflict – The Fate of Rahu</h2>
      <p><strong>The Trick of the Divine Enchantress</strong></p>
  
      <p>"O Lords of Might," Mohini’s voice rang like music over water. "You hold the nectar of immortality, but such a sacred gift must be given with fairness. Should it not be distributed by one who is impartial?"</p>
  
      <p>The Asuras, bewitched, nodded in agreement.</p>
  
      <p>With a playful smile, Mohini took the Amrita into her delicate hands.</p>
  
      <p>The Devas dared not breathe.</p>
  
      <p>One by one, Mohini began serving the nectar, moving with divine grace. The Asuras sat in eager anticipation, waiting for their turn.</p>
  
      <p>But there was a secret in her movements.</p>
  
      <p>For only the Devas drank.</p>
  
      <p>Drop by drop, the nectar flowed only into the cups of the gods, their strength returning, their radiance restored.</p>
  
      <p>Yet in the Asura ranks, one among them watched with suspicion.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Rahu.</strong></p>
  
      <p>A demon of cunning, he alone saw the deception woven into Mohini’s hands. Slipping into the line of the gods, he disguised himself as a Deva and took his seat between Surya (the sun god) and Chandra (the moon god).</p>
  
      <p>Mohini, unknowing, poured the Amrita into his hands.</p>
  
      <p>Rahu drank.</p>
  
      <p>For a moment, his body shimmered with divine energy.</p>
  
      <p>Immortality was his.</p>
  
      <p>But before the nectar could reach his throat, Surya and Chandra cried out.</p>
  
      <p>"This is no god! He is one of them!"</p>
  
      <p>Vishnu turned in an instant. With a flick of his fingers, his Sudarshana Chakra—the divine discus—sliced through the heavens.</p>
  
      <p>It struck Rahu’s neck before the nectar could pass fully into his body.</p>
  
      <p>His head, now immortal, soared into the sky. His body, still mortal, fell lifeless to the ground.</p>
  
      <p>From that moment, Rahu’s severed head became a shadow planet, destined to roam the cosmos. In vengeance, he would eternally chase the sun and moon, swallowing them whenever he could—thus causing the eclipses.</p>
  
      <p>But the battle was over.</p>
  
      <p>The Devas had won.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>Resolution – Balance Restored</h2>
      <p><strong>The Gods Return to Glory</strong></p>
  
      <p>The Asuras, realizing their deception, rose in fury. But it was too late. The Devas, restored by Amrita, shone with divine might.</p>
  
      <p>With a single cry from Indra, the battle resumed—but this time, the gods held the upper hand.</p>
  
      <p>One by one, the Asuras fell or fled, their immortality forever lost.</p>
  
      <p>The heavens thundered. Balance had returned.</p>
  
      <p>Far above, Vishnu stood once more in his true form, his gaze serene.</p>
  
      <p>The cycle had played its course.</p>
  
      <p>The Devas reclaimed their thrones. Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity, smiled upon them once more.</p>
  
      <p>And as the Ocean of Milk grew still, Vishnu vanished into eternity, leaving only the echo of his wisdom behind.</p>
  
      <p>For in the end, the greatest victories are not won by strength alone—but by foresight, patience, and the hand of destiny.</p>
