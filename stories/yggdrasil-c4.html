            <h2>The Light of Asgard</h2>
            <p><strong>"He was the fairest of the gods, beloved by all, yet even the brightest light casts the darkest shadow."</strong></p>
            <p>In the golden halls of Asgard, where laughter once echoed like music and the gods feasted without fear, there was one who shone brighter than all others—Baldr, the god of light, beauty, and purity. His presence was a balm to gods and mortals alike, his face radiant, his spirit untouchable by sorrow. To know Baldr was to know joy, and his life was thought as eternal as Yggdrasil itself.</p>
            <p>But even the gods cannot escape the threads woven by the Norns. Baldr began to dream—dark dreams of shadows swallowing the sun, of cold fingers clutching his heart, of death creeping where none had walked before. The dreams unsettled Asgard, for dreams in the land of gods are not mere illusions—they are omens.</p>
            <p>Frigg, Baldr’s mother, consumed by fear, vowed to protect her son. She traveled across the Nine Realms, extracting promises from all things—fire, water, metal, stone, beasts, and even sickness—not to harm her beloved child. All swore the oath. All except one small, overlooked thing: mistletoe, deemed too young, too insignificant to be of any threat.</p>

            <h2>The Trickster’s Betrayal</h2>
            <p><strong>"It is not the spear that kills the god, but the hand that guides it—and the heart that wishes it so."</strong></p>
            <p>Loki’s mind, sharp as shattered glass, sought the flaw in Frigg’s protections. In the guise of an old woman, he approached her, feigning sympathy, asking gently, "Surely, you did not ask everything in the world to spare Baldr?"</p>
            <p>Frigg, unaware of the deception, replied, "All things swore the oath, save for mistletoe. It is too young, too harmless."</p>
            <p>Loki’s smile was hidden beneath the mask of kindness.</p>
            <p>He crafted a spear from mistletoe—slender, pale, and deadly. Then he approached Höðr, Baldr’s blind brother, who stood apart from the gods’ games, sorrowful in his darkness, unable to join in the sport. Loki placed the spear in Höðr’s hands, whispering, "Why not honor your brother? I will guide your aim."</p>
            <p>Höðr, trusting the voice of a god he believed a friend, hurled the spear.</p>
            <p>The mistletoe flew straight and true. It pierced Baldr’s heart, and the god of light fell.</p>

            <h2>The Descent into Darkness</h2>
            <p><strong>"Even in death, the light casts a shadow. And in that shadow, vengeance grows."</strong></p>
            <p>The gods wept. Even Odin, the Allfather who had stared into the abyss, felt a grief deeper than the wisdom he’d sacrificed so much to gain. Baldr’s death was not just the loss of a son, a brother, or a friend—it was the first true wound in the heart of Asgard, a wound that would never heal.</p>
            <p>In desperation, Odin sent Hermóðr, the swiftest of the gods, to ride to Hel, the shadowy realm of the dead, to plead for Baldr’s return. Hel, daughter of Loki and queen of the dead, listened with cold indifference. She set a cruel condition: "If all things in the world weep for Baldr, he may return. But if even one refuses, he is mine."</p>
            <p>All things wept—trees, stones, beasts, even the earth itself. All except one: a giantess named Þökk, who refused. Some say it was Loki in disguise, his vengeance complete.</p>
            <p>Baldr remained in Hel’s grasp.</p>
            <p>—To be continued in Chapter 5: The Beginning of the End.</p>
