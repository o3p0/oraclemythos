      <h2>Setup â€“ The Betrayal Begins</h2>
      <p><strong>A March Toward Blood</strong></p>
      <p>The night was heavy with whispers of treachery.</p>
      <p>Coyolxauhqui, the golden-belled warrior, stood at the head of her army. Behind her, the 400 starsâ€”her brothersâ€”sharpened their obsidian blades.</p>
      <p>They moved swiftly toward Coatepec, the Serpent Mountain, where their mother, Coatlicue, waitedâ€”pregnant with shame.</p>
      <p>"She has dishonored us," Coyolxauhqui hissed. "She carries a child, yet no father is known. This thing inside her is unnatural."</p>
      <p>Her brothers gripped their weapons, their faces dark with rage.</p>
      <p>"We must strike before it is born."</p>
      <p>The mountain loomed before them. Their motherâ€™s final moments had come.</p>

      <h2>Conflict â€“ The Birth of the Sun</h2>
      <p><strong>The Child Who Was Ready</strong></p>
      <p>Coatlicue knelt within the temple atop the mountain.</p>
      <p>She had no weapons, no way to defend herself.</p>
      <p>She could already feel the blades of her children, the betrayal rising like a storm.</p>
      <p>But deep within her womb, something stirred.</p>
      <p>A voiceâ€”clear and sharp as obsidian.</p>
      <p>"Do not be afraid, Mother. I am here."</p>
      <p>Before the first blade could fallâ€”before the traitors could spill her bloodâ€”</p>
      <p>ðŸ”¥ The child burst from her body, fully grown, fully armed. ðŸ”¥</p>
      <p>Huitzilopochtli had risen.</p>
      <p>In his hands, he wielded a serpent of fire. His face gleamed with the blue light of the sky. His body burned with the heat of war itself.</p>
      <p>He was not an infant. He was a warrior.</p>
      <p>And he did not hesitate.</p>

      <h2>Resolution â€“ The First Strike of the War God</h2>
      <p><strong>A Goddess Falls</strong></p>
      <p>The stars staggered, caught between shock and fear.</p>
      <p>Coyolxauhqui, their mighty leader, raised her shield.</p>
      <p>"Stand firm!" she commanded. "He is only one!"</p>
      <p>But Huitzilopochtli moved like lightning.</p>
      <p>ðŸ”¥ He struck with the fire-serpent Xiuhcoatl.</p>
      <p>ðŸ”¥ His blade cut through the darkness like the first dawn.</p>
      <p>One by one, the stars fell.</p>
      <p>The sky shook, the earth wept, and blood stained the mountain.</p>
      <p>Coyolxauhqui faced him last.</p>
      <p>She fought fiercely, but she was no match for the sun.</p>
      <p>With a single, devastating blowâ€”Huitzilopochtli severed her head.</p>
      <p>The stars cried out, but it was too late.</p>
      <p>Their leader was no more.</p>
      <p>Her body tumbled down the mountainside, breaking apart as it fellâ€” A goddess shattered, never to rise again.</p>
      <p>Above, the heavens stirred. Her head rose into the sky, her light dim, defeated.</p>
      <p>She would forever hang above the world, her face pale with loss.</p>
      <p>Coyolxauhqui had become the moon.</p>
