      <h2>Setup â€“ Into the Unknown</h2>
      <p><strong>Chapter 5: The Legend of a God</strong></p>
  
      <p>âš¡ Sango is no longer a king. He is no longer a man. But does his destiny end in exileâ€¦ or does it begin? ðŸ”¥</p>
  
      <p>Deep in the forests beyond Oyo, Sango walked alone. His royal robes were torn, his golden crown left behind in the ashes of his kingdom. The mighty thunder godâ€”once feared, once worshipedâ€”was now a fugitive.</p>
  
      <p>The rivers whispered his name. The trees murmured of his fall. But Sango did not stop.</p>
  
      <p>He walked for days. Weeks.</p>
  
      <p>His power, once unstoppable, had turned against him. Each time he raised his hands, the sky trembled. Lightning flashed, but it was no longer his to command. Was he even a god anymore?</p>
  
      <p>As he approached a great mountain, his vision blurred. His body, once invincible, felt weak. Hunger gnawed at him. His strength was failing.</p>
  
      <p>And thenâ€¦</p>
  
      <p>A voice.</p>
  
      <p>"Sangoâ€¦ is this truly how your story ends?"</p>

      <h2>Conflict & Action â€“ The Trial of Fire and Thunder</h2>
      <p><strong>The Trial of Fire and Thunder</strong></p>
  
      <p>Sango turned sharply. Before him stood a figure, wreathed in flame and shadow.</p>
  
      <p>It was Orunmila, the Orisha of wisdom, the one who saw the past, present, and future all at once. His eyes glowed like molten gold.</p>
  
      <p>"You were given power beyond kings, beyond warriors, beyond mortals," Orunmila said. "Yet you ran. Why?"</p>
  
      <p>Sango clenched his fists.<br>
      "I had no choice."</p>
  
      <p>A bolt of lightning cracked the sky. Orunmilaâ€™s gaze did not waver.<br>
      "You always had a choice. Do you wish to remain a broken king, or will you embrace what you have become?"</p>
  
      <p>The ground beneath Sango shook. The air burned.</p>
  
      <p>Flames rose around him, and from the fire came voices.</p>
  
      <p>The cries of the people of Oyo.</p>
  
      <p>The screams of warriors in battle.</p>
  
      <p>The whispers of the gods.</p>
  
      <p>Sangoâ€™s past surrounded him, every triumph, every mistake, every moment of rage. The fire would consume himâ€¦ unless he faced it.</p>
  
      <p>ðŸ”¥ He stepped forward. ðŸ”¥</p>
  
      <p>Into the storm. Into the fire. Into his fate.</p>

      <h2>Resolution & Cliffhanger â€“ The Birth of a God</h2>
      <p><strong>The Birth of a God</strong></p>
  
      <p>The flames did not burn him.</p>
  
      <p>The lightning did not strike him down.</p>
  
      <p>Instead, they became a part of him.</p>
  
      <p>Sango threw back his head and roared. The sky answered.</p>
  
      <p>ðŸ”¥âš¡ A new storm was born. âš¡ðŸ”¥</p>
  
      <p>When the fire faded, Sango stood taller. Stronger. His eyes burned like molten gold. His body crackled with lightning, his very breath stirred the winds.</p>
  
      <p>He was no longer just a king. No longer just a warrior.</p>
  
      <p>He had become an Orisha.</p>
  
      <p>The thunder god, reborn.</p>
  
      <p>Far away, in the ruins of Oyo, Oya lifted her head. She felt the shift in the wind.</p>
  
      <p>"He has returned."</p>
  
      <p>The legend of Sango had just begun.</p>
