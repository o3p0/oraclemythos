      <h2>Setup ‚Äì The End of the Fourth Sun</h2>
      <p><strong>A World Without Light</strong></p>
      <p>The Fourth Sun had died.</p>
      <p>The world lay in shadow, the heavens silent. The wind carried only whispers of destruction, the remnants of the last age. Nothing moved. Nothing grew.</p>
      <p>The gods stood in Teotihuacan, the sacred place where the fate of the cosmos was decided.</p>
      <p>"If there is no sun," said the gods, "there is no world."</p>
      <p>But to create a new sun, a great sacrifice would be required.</p>
      <p>The gods turned to one another.</p>
      <p>"Who among us will give their life?"</p>
      <p>There was silence.</p>
      <p>Then, a voice rose.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>Conflict ‚Äì The Choosing of the Sacrifice</h2>
      <p><strong>The Humble & The Proud</strong></p>
      <p>A sickly, blemished god stepped forward. He was Nanahuatzin, covered in sores, dressed in rags. He was weak in body, but strong in spirit.</p>
      <p>"I will go," he said without hesitation.</p>
      <p>The gods murmured.</p>
      <p>Nanahuatzin was lowly, insignificant. Could such a god be worthy of the sun‚Äôs divine fire?</p>
      <p>Before they could answer, another stepped forward. He was Tecciztecatl, adorned in gold and jade, a god of wealth and pride.</p>
      <p>"I will be the sun," he declared, his voice filled with certainty.</p>
      <p>The gods were pleased.</p>
      <p>"Yes," they said. "A god of power and beauty is fit for the heavens."</p>
      <p>But the ritual required two offerings. One god would rise first, the other would follow.</p>
      <p>And so, they prepared the Trial of Fire.</p>
      <p>A great pyre was built, its flames stretching toward the heavens.</p>
      <p>"Let the gods prove their courage," they declared. "Let them leap into the fire."</p>
      <p>Nanahuatzin and Tecciztecatl stood before the flames. The test had begun.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>Resolution ‚Äì The Flames Await</h2>
      <p><strong>The Moment of Truth</strong></p>
      <p>The fire roared, waiting.</p>
      <p>Tecciztecatl stepped forward. His golden ornaments gleamed. His cloak of feathers shimmered.</p>
      <p>He gazed into the searing abyss‚Ä¶ and hesitated.</p>
      <p>The heat was terrible. The flames hungry.</p>
      <p>His foot wavered.</p>
      <p>Once. Twice. Three times. Four.</p>
      <p>But he could not jump.</p>
      <p>The gods watched in silence.</p>
      <p>Then, Nanahuatzin moved.</p>
      <p>He did not hesitate. He did not falter.</p>
      <p>With no fear, no doubt, no regret, he threw himself into the fire.</p>
      <p>The flames embraced him.</p>
      <p>The gods gasped.</p>
      <p>The air shimmered.</p>
      <p>Nanahuatzin was gone.</p>
      <p>Only then, shamed by his hesitation, did Tecciztecatl leap after him.</p>
      <p>The fire consumed them both.</p>
      <p>And the sky began to change.</p>
      <p>For from the ashes, the sun was rising.</p>
