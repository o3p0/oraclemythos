      <h2>A Kingâ€™s Final Decision</h2>
      <p><strong>Chapter 10 â€“ The Legacy of Sango: From King to Orisha ðŸ”¥</strong></p>
  
      <p>The storm had passed, but its echoes remained. Sango, once a mortal warrior, now stood at the crossroads of his destiny. His name had spread across the lands, carried by the winds of Oya and the thunder of his own power.</p>
  
      <p>Yet, power alone was never enough. A kingâ€™s rule could be challenged. A warriorâ€™s strength could be matched. But a legend? A legend lived forever.</p>
  
      <p>Before him stood the shrine of the Orishas, the sacred place where only those chosen by the divine could ascend. Oya waited at the entrance, her gaze piercing, her presence like the shifting winds of fate.</p>
  
      <p>"The world will remember you, Sango," she said. "But how they remember youâ€¦ that is your choice."</p>
  
      <p>Would he remain among men, ruling as a king of flesh and blood? Or would he step beyond mortality, becoming something greaterâ€”an Orisha of fire, thunder, and destiny?</p>
  
      <p>Sango took a deep breath. The air crackled around him. This was the final moment.</p>
  
      <p>The final choice.</p>

      <h2>The Ascension of the Thunder God</h2>
      <p><strong>The Ascension of the Thunder God</strong></p>
  
      <p>Sango turned to his people one last time. They watched him in reverence, waiting for his decision.</p>
  
      <p>He could see it in their eyesâ€”loyalty, love, and the unshakable belief that he was more than just a king. He was a force of nature. A storm given form.</p>
  
      <p>He stepped forward. His voice, when he spoke, carried the weight of thunder itself.</p>
  
      <p>"I have fought for this kingdom. I have bled for my people. And now, I give you something greaterâ€”a god to watch over you."</p>
  
      <p>As he raised his arms, the skies split open. A bolt of lightning struck him, but Sango did not fall. His body burned with divine fire. His eyes became as bright as the storm.</p>
  
      <p>Oya lifted her hands, summoning the winds. The Orishas above called his name.</p>
  
      <p>With one final breath, Sango leaped into the heavens.</p>
  
      <p>The fire did not consume him. The lightning did not break him.</p>
  
      <p>Instead, he became them.</p>

      <h2>The Eternal Legend of Sango</h2>
      <p><strong>The Eternal Legend of Sango</strong></p>
  
      <p>From that day forward, Sango was no longer just a warrior, nor just a king. He became the Orisha of Thunder and Fire, his presence felt in every storm, his name whispered in every clap of lightning.</p>
  
      <p>His people built temples in his honor, calling upon him for strength, for justice, for the fury of the storm when they needed it most.</p>
  
      <p>And when the skies rumbled, when the heavens flashed with fire, they did not cower in fear.</p>
  
      <p>They lifted their heads, smiled, and knew:</p>
  
      <p><strong>Sango still reigned. âš¡ðŸ”¥</strong></p>
