            <h2>The Cracks in the Cosmos</h2>
            <p>"The death of one god was but the first stone cast into the lake—its ripples would drown the world."</p>
            <p>Baldr’s death left more than an empty throne in Asgard—it fractured the very fabric of the Nine Realms. His light had been the heart of the gods, and without it, shadows grew deeper, not just in the world but within the hearts of the gods themselves.</p>
            <p>Odin, haunted by the echoes of prophecy, roamed far and wide, seeking knowledge beyond knowledge, answers hidden even from the runes he had once bled for. His ravens, Huginn and Muninn, flew across the realms, whispering of signs that could no longer be ignored:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Fimbulwinter had begun—a long, unending winter, cold and cruel, stretching across Midgard, chilling even the fires of Muspelheim.</li>
                <li>Brothers turned against brothers, sons rose against fathers, and kinship was broken in mortal and divine realms alike.</li>
                <li>The bonds of Loki grew weak as his hatred festered beneath the earth, and the serpent Jörmungandr stirred in the oceans, its coils tightening around the world.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the roots of Yggdrasil, Níðhöggr gnawed more eagerly, as if tasting the decay spreading through the cosmos. The World Tree, eternal yet not unbreakable, trembled.</p>
            <p>Odin knew: Ragnarök had already begun.</p>

            <h2>The Breaking of Bonds</h2>
            <p>"When the last chain breaks, so too shall the world."</p>
            <p>Far beneath the earth, bound in darkness, Loki’s laughter echoed. His punishment had only hardened his heart, his bitterness seeping into the cracks of the world like poison. His chains—crafted from the entrails of his son—were strong, but his hatred was stronger.</p>
            <p>The earth quaked. Mountains split. The sea roared. And with a final, shattering crack, Loki broke free.</p>
            <p>His first act was vengeance. He gathered the broken, the outcast, and the damned:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The jötunn (giants) of Jotunheim, thirsty for retribution against Asgard.</li>
                <li>His monstrous children: Fenrir, whose bonds shattered like brittle ice, and Jörmungandr, whose massive form rose from the depths, its venom blackening the seas.</li>
                <li>The armies of the dead, led by Hel, his daughter, marching from her shadowy realm.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Meanwhile, in Asgard, the gods prepared for war. Odin donned his armor, the spear Gungnir gleaming in his hand. Thor gripped Mjölnir, his jaw set, lightning dancing in his eyes. The gods gathered not with hope of victory, but with grim determination, knowing this was the battle they had been born to fight—and fated to lose.</p>

            <h2>The Final March</h2>
            <p>"The gods will fall. The realms will burn. But from the ashes, something new will rise."</p>
            <p>The skies darkened as Loki’s army surged across the Bifröst, the Rainbow Bridge shattering under their fury. The clash of gods and giants echoed across the Nine Realms, shaking Yggdrasil to its core.</p>
            <p>In the distance, Odin rode to meet his doom, seeking Fenrir, the beast prophesied to devour him. Thor stormed toward Jörmungandr, their fates intertwined like the serpent’s coils around the world.</p>
            <p>But even as the gods fought, Yggdrasil burned—not with fire, but with the unraveling of existence itself.</p>
            <p>Yet, in the heart of the chaos, a whisper remained—of life beyond death, of rebirth beyond destruction. For even as Yggdrasil trembled, its roots reached deep, holding a fragile seed untouched by flame or frost.</p>
            <p>—To be continued in Chapter 6: The Twilight of the Gods.</p>
