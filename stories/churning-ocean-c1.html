      <h2>The Fall of the Devas</h2>
      <p><strong>A Curse Upon the Gods</strong></p>
  
      <p>Once, the Devas ruled the heavens with divine strength, their power unmatched, their radiance unchallenged. But power breeds pride, and pride invites downfall.</p>
  
      <p>One day, the great sage Durvasa, known for his fiery temper, approached Indra, the king of the gods, bearing a garland of celestial flowers. A gift of immeasurable blessing.</p>
  
      <p>Indra, astride his white elephant Airavata, took the garland carelessly and placed it upon his mount’s head. The scent was overwhelming. Airavata, in discomfort, shook its head, casting the sacred offering to the ground.</p>
  
      <p>Durvasa’s eyes blazed with fury.</p>
  
      <p>"You, who rule the heavens, have forgotten humility!" he thundered. "You scorn divine gifts as if they are beneath you. Very well—let arrogance be your ruin!"</p>
  
      <p>With those words, the curse fell upon the Devas.</p>
  
      <p>One by one, their divine energies withered. Their bodies, once radiant, grew pale. Their weapons, once mighty, lost their potency.</p>
  
      <p>Sensing their weakness, the Asuras (demons) rose like a storm. They struck with vengeance, seizing Swarga (the celestial realm) and driving the gods from their thrones.</p>
  
      <p>The Devas, powerless and exiled, wandered the earth, searching for hope.</p>
  
      <p>And so, they turned to Vishnu, the Preserver.</p>

      <h2>Vishnu’s Plan</h2>
      <p><strong>A Trick in the Making</strong></p>
  
      <p>From the depths of the cosmic ocean, Vishnu emerged upon Ananta, the great serpent of eternity. His skin shone deep blue, his gaze calm yet piercing.</p>
  
      <p>The Devas fell to their knees.</p>
  
      <p>"O Lord," Indra pleaded, "We have been cast down, our strength stolen. The Asuras have claimed the heavens. Is there no way to restore balance?"</p>
  
      <p>Vishnu closed his eyes, his mind reaching into the fabric of destiny.</p>
  
      <p>"There is a way," he said at last. "But it will require patience, cunning, and the toil of gods and demons alike."</p>
  
      <p>The Devas listened in silence as Vishnu revealed his plan.</p>
  
      <p>"The nectar of immortality—Amrita—lies hidden within the depths of the Kshira Sagara, the Ocean of Milk. But to retrieve it, the ocean must be churned, like butter from cream."</p>
  
      <p>The gods stirred. The task seemed impossible.</p>
  
      <p>"We cannot do this alone," Agni, the god of fire, admitted. "We are weak."</p>
  
      <p>"Yes," Vishnu said, a glint of mischief in his eyes. "That is why you must seek the help of the Asuras."</p>
  
      <p>A murmur of protest rose among the gods. The Asuras were their sworn enemies!</p>
  
      <p>"Offer them a share of the nectar," Vishnu continued. "They will agree. But fear not—I shall ensure that the Amrita reaches only you."</p>
  
      <p>Understanding dawned upon Indra’s face. A deception was in motion.</p>
  
      <p>If they could trick the Asuras, if they could reclaim their strength, then the heavens would be theirs once more.</p>
  
      <p>And so, the Devas reluctantly sought an alliance with their greatest foes.</p>

      <h2>The Pact of Gods and Demons</h2>
      <p><strong>Enemies Turned Allies</strong></p>
  
      <p>The Asuras, ever ambitious, listened as Indra spoke.</p>
  
      <p>"The Ocean of Milk hides a power beyond imagining—Amrita, the nectar of immortality. If we churn it together, we shall all share in its rewards."</p>
  
      <p>The demons, led by their king, Bali, exchanged glances. They were strong now, victorious, yet true immortality had always eluded them.</p>
  
      <p>At last, Bali nodded.</p>
  
      <p>"We accept."</p>
  
      <p>Thus, the pact was sealed. Devas and Asuras, sworn enemies since time immemorial, would work together.</p>
  
      <p>The Ocean of Milk awaited, and deep within its waves, destiny began to stir.</p>
  
      <p>But Vishnu, watching from above, smiled knowingly.</p>
  
      <p>For the gods and demons had set their hands upon the rope of fate, but only he knew how the churning would end.</p>
