      <h2>The Flames of Teotihuacan</h2>
      <p><strong>The Gods Await the Leap</strong></p>
      <p>The fire roared, its golden tongues reaching toward the heavens.</p>
      <p>All of Teotihuacan stood in silence. The gods had gathered, forming a circle around the sacred pyre.</p>
      <p>Two figures stood before the flames.</p>
      <p>üî• Nanahuatzin‚Äîsickly, scarred, yet unshaken.<br>üî• Tecciztecatl‚Äîadorned in gold, proud, yet hesitant.</p>
      <p>"Now is the time," the gods declared. "Leap into the fire, and the sun shall rise again!"</p>
      <p>But the flames burned hotter than any fire before it.</p>
      <p>This was no ordinary blaze‚Äîthis was the fire of creation itself.</p>
      <p>Who would step forward first?</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>Hesitation & Sacrifice</h2>
      <p><strong>The Proud God Falters</strong></p>
      <p>Tecciztecatl took a deep breath.</p>
      <p>He had prepared for this moment. He had adorned himself with precious stones, the finest feathers, the rarest gold‚Äîall to prove his worth.</p>
      <p>He stepped forward.</p>
      <p>The heat struck him like a blow.</p>
      <p>The flames twisted, alive, watching.</p>
      <p>His foot hovered over the abyss‚Ä¶ and then he stopped.</p>
      <p>His heart wavered. His body shook.</p>
      <p>He stepped back.</p>
      <p>The gods frowned.</p>
      <p>"Try again," they said.</p>
      <p>So Tecciztecatl stepped forward a second time.</p>
      <p>Again, the fire screamed, the air crackled, and his feet would not move.</p>
      <p>A third time he tried. A fourth.</p>
      <p>Each time, fear gripped him.</p>
      <p>He could not do it.</p>
      <p>The gods turned to Nanahuatzin.</p>
      <p>The humble god did not hesitate.</p>
      <p>He did not speak.</p>
      <p>He did not wait.</p>
      <p>He ran forward and hurled himself into the fire.</p>
      <p>The flames exploded, consuming him in an instant.</p>
      <p>A great light filled the sky.</p>
      <p>The gods gasped‚Äîfor Nanahuatzin was no more.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>The Sun is Born</h2>
      <p><strong>The Shamed God Follows</strong></p>
      <p>Tecciztecatl stared in horror.</p>
      <p>He had hesitated too long.</p>
      <p>Nanahuatzin had taken his place.</p>
      <p>Ashamed, Tecciztecatl finally leaped into the flames.</p>
      <p>But the fire had already chosen.</p>
      <p>Nanahuatzin‚Äôs light shone brighter than all the stars.</p>
      <p>He rose from the pyre, his body transformed, his face ablaze.</p>
      <p>He had become Tonatiuh‚Äîthe Sun. ‚òÄÔ∏è</p>
      <p>Tecciztecatl rose after him, but his light was pale, weak in comparison.</p>
      <p>He had become Meztli‚Äîthe Moon. üåô</p>
      <p>The gods gazed upward. The new Sun and Moon hung in the sky, but something was wrong.</p>
      <p>They did not move.</p>
      <p>The heavens remained still.</p>
      <p>"The sun has been born," the gods whispered, "but why does it not rise?"</p>
      <p>Something was missing.</p>
      <p>The Fifth Sun had not yet begun its journey.</p>
      <p>And the gods knew what must be done.</p>
