            <h2>The Axis of the Cosmos</h2>
            <p><strong>“I know an ash tree that stands, Yggdrasil its name, a tall, mighty tree sprinkled with white water…” — Völuspá</strong></p>
            <p>Before gods carved their runes and men built their halls, there was Yggdrasil—the Eternal Ash, the Axis of the Nine Realms. Its roots burrow deep into the abyss, its branches pierce the heavens, and its trunk binds together the fates of gods, giants, humans, and creatures beyond reckoning.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One root reaches into Asgard, where the wise drink from Mímisbrunnr, the Well of Wisdom.</li>
                <li>Another plunges into Midgard, where the Norns weave fate's tapestry.</li>
                <li>The third stretches into Niflheim, where the dragon Níðhöggr gnaws endlessly at its roots.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Creatures inhabit Yggdrasil:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An eagle perches atop, its piercing gaze spanning the realms.</li>
                <li>Níðhöggr coils below, devouring the dead.</li>
                <li>Ratatoskr, the trickster squirrel, carries insults from root to crown, spreading discord.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Yet Yggdrasil is more than wood and leaf—it breathes, it bleeds, and it remembers.</p>

            <h2>The Struggles Within the Tree</h2>
            <p><strong>Even the Eternal Can Bleed</strong></p>
            <p>Though eternal, Yggdrasil suffers. Its roots tremble under Níðhöggr’s bite, its bark is scarred by time, and its branches sway under the weight of prophecy.</p>
            <p>The gods of Asgard gather beneath its boughs, pondering the runes that whisper of Ragnarök, the twilight of the gods, when Yggdrasil itself will shudder as the Nine Realms burn.</p>
            <p>Tensions ripple through the tree:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Giants in Jotunheim plot the downfall of the gods.</li>
                <li>Surtr, the fire giant, sharpens his blade, waiting to burn the world.</li>
                <li>Loki stirs chaos, his lies snaking through the realms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Yggdrasil holds it all—the triumphs, the betrayals, the rise, and the inevitable fall.</p>

            <h2>The Sacrifice for Wisdom</h2>
            <p><strong>Knowledge Carved in Pain</strong></p>
            <p>Odin, god of wisdom and war, sought to unravel the secrets hidden within Yggdrasil’s roots. But knowledge has a price.</p>
            <p>He hung himself from Yggdrasil’s branches, pierced by his own spear, Gungnir—a sacrifice not of blood, but of self. For nine days and nine nights, he dangled between life and death, denied food, water, and comfort, his soul drifting through the void.</p>
            <p>In agony, he gazed into the abyss, and the abyss gazed back.</p>
            <p>On the ninth day, the runes revealed themselves—not just symbols, but the very language of fate, etched into the bones of the cosmos. Odin fell from the tree, reborn not as a god untouched by time, but as one who had seen beyond it.</p>
            <p>But wisdom is a double-edged blade. In his newfound sight, Odin saw the threads of destiny—and at the end of every thread, he saw Ragnarök. The fall of gods. The death of heroes. The burning of Yggdrasil.</p>
            <p>Yet in the ashes of that vision, he saw something else—a fragile hope. A whisper that even after the fire, life will grow again.</p>
            <p>—To be continued in Chapter 2: The Prophecy of Ragnarök.</p>
