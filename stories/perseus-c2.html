            <h2>The Edge of the World</h2>
            <p><strong>Where Mortals Dare Not Tread</strong></p>
            <p>Guided by the whispers of the Graeae, Perseus journeyed to a place where maps ended and legends began—a desolate land scarred by ancient battles, where statues stood not carved by hands, but by fear itself. Warriors frozen mid-scream, swords raised against an enemy they never saw.</p>
            <p>This was the domain of the Gorgons—sisters cursed and monstrous, but only one was mortal: Medusa, the doom Perseus sought.</p>
            <p>Clutching his divine gifts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hermes’ winged sandals, to glide above the ground like a shadow.</li>
                <li>The Cap of Invisibility, stolen from Hades’ realm, to cloak him from sight.</li>
                <li>Athena’s mirrored shield, polished to perfection.</li>
                <li>The adamantine sword, sharp enough to sever fate itself.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
            <h2>The Monster’s Gaze</h2>
            <p><strong>Face the Monster Without Facing It</strong></p>
            <p>In the heart of the cursed land, Perseus found Medusa—not roaring in rage, but sleeping, her serpents hissing softly like whispers in the dark. She was not the beast of nightmares, but something far worse: a woman twisted by betrayal, her beauty replaced with scales and sorrow.</p>
            <p>Perseus dared not meet her eyes. Instead, he moved backward, guided only by the reflection in Athena’s shield—each step a dance with death, each heartbeat a drum against the silence.</p>
            <p>Raising the sword, he struck.</p>
            <p>In a flash of divine steel, Medusa’s head was severed from her body, her face forever frozen in a final, silent scream.</p>

            <h2>The Price of Victory</h2>
            <p><strong>The Head That Never Sleeps</strong></p>
            <p>Perseus placed Medusa’s head in the magic satchel, careful to avoid even a stray glance, for her power endured beyond death. Her gaze still petrified the living—a trophy and a curse.</p>
            <p>But the Gorgon’s sisters, Stheno and Euryale, awoke to the scent of blood and the absence of their kin. Their screams shattered the silence, echoing across the barren wasteland. They pursued Perseus with inhuman fury, their footsteps shaking the ground.</p>
            <p>Wings carried Perseus skyward, but vengeance followed close behind.</p>
            <p>—To be continued in Chapter 3: The Return of the Hero.</p>
