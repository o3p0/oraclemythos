      <h2>The Stone That Held the Heavens’ Secret</h2>
      <p><strong>A Mountain Blessed by Heaven & Earth</strong></p>
      <p>At the heart of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit (花果山), where waterfalls roared like celestial drums and mist curled over emerald peaks, lay a boulder unlike any other.</p>
      <p>🌌 It was no ordinary rock. 🌌</p>
      <p>For eons, it had absorbed the essence of heaven and earth, drinking in the light of the sun and moon, pulsing with the breath of the universe itself.</p>
      <p>Then—it cracked.</p>
      <p>A great wind howled through the mountain valleys. Thunder rolled across the sky. The heavens took notice.</p>
      <p>And from the stone, a figure leaped forth—</p>
      <p>🔥 A monkey, golden-eyed, wreathed in light, born of chaos itself. 🔥</p>
      <p>The moment his feet touched the earth, light split the clouds. From the celestial palaces, the Jade Emperor (玉皇大帝) turned his gaze toward the mortal realm.</p>
      <p>"This creature is no ordinary beast," the gods murmured.</p>

      <h2>The Rise of a King</h2>
      <p><strong>The Monkey Without Fear</strong></p>
      <p>The newborn was no mere animal.</p>
      <p>⚡ He ran faster than the river’s current.<br>⚡ He leaped higher than the tallest pine.<br>⚡ He laughed in the face of the storm, fearless and wild.</p>
      <p>Among the monkeys of the mountain, he was unlike any other.</p>
      <p>One day, as they roamed the cliffs, they found a great waterfall, its waters vanishing into the rock.</p>
      <p>"Who dares enter first?" the monkeys whispered.</p>
      <p>The stone monkey only grinned.</p>
      <p>With a single bound—he leaped through the crashing water.</p>
      <p>Beyond the falls lay a hidden cave, a palace of stone, untouched by time.</p>
      <p>🏯 A kingdom, waiting for a ruler. 🏯</p>
      <p>The monkeys, awed by his boldness, bowed.</p>
      <p>"You shall be our king!" they cried.</p>
      <p>And so he was.</p>
      <p>🌟 Sun Wukong (孙悟空), the Monkey King, was born. 🌟</p>
      <p>But a king must be more than fearless—and soon, he would crave more than a mountain throne.</p>

      <h2>The Call to Power</h2>
      <p><strong>A King Who Would Challenge the Heavens</strong></p>
      <p>For years, Sun Wukong ruled the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit with joy.</p>
      <p>But joy is fleeting, and the mind of a god-born creature never rests.</p>
      <p>One evening, he sat before the sea, watching the sun sink into the horizon.</p>
      <p>"Even the sky itself moves on," he mused.</p>
      <p>"I am king of this mountain, but what is a king compared to the immortals? To the gods?"</p>
      <p>🔥 His heart burned for more. 🔥</p>
      <p>The heavens had given him life— Now he would take his place among them.</p>
      <p>With nothing but his wit and his will, the Monkey King set out—</p>
      <p>To seek the power that even the gods would fear.</p>
