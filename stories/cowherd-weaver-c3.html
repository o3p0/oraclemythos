      <h2>The Ascent to the Heavens</h2>
      <p><strong>A Mortal’s Journey Beyond the Sky</strong></p>
      <p>Niulang did not hesitate.</p>
      <p>🔥 Wrapped in the hide of his faithful ox, he soared into the sky. 🔥</p>
      <p>The world below faded into mist, and the heavens stretched before him like an endless sea.</p>
      <p>His children clung tightly to his robes as the wind howled around them.</p>
      <p>Ahead, beyond the silver clouds, stood the celestial palace—its gates of jade and pearl gleaming under the eternal sun.</p>
      <p>And there—Zhinü.</p>
      <p>Her hands were bound in silken cords, her eyes filled with tears that shimmered like starlight.</p>
      <p>"Niulang!" she cried.</p>
      <p>The celestial maidens turned in shock.</p>
      <p>No mortal had ever breached the heavens.</p>

      <h2>The Jade Emperor’s Final Decree</h2>
      <p><strong>A Barrier That Can Never Be Crossed</strong></p>
      <p>Thunder rolled across the sky.</p>
      <p>The clouds split apart, and from the highest throne of the heavens, a voice shook the stars themselves.</p>
      <p>"This cannot be."</p>
      <p>🔥 The Jade Emperor (玉皇大帝)—ruler of all creation—rose from his seat.<br>
         🔥 The Queen Mother of the West (王母娘娘), guardian of divine order, narrowed her gaze.</p>
      <p>A mortal had entered the celestial realm.</p>
      <p>It was unforgivable.</p>
      <p>With a wave of the Jade Emperor’s hand, a great river appeared—vast, endless, uncrossable.</p>
      <p>🌌 It stretched across the heavens, dividing Niulang and Zhinü.</p>
      <p>🌌 It became the 银河 (Yínhé), the Celestial River—the Milky Way.</p>
      <p>One side—Niulang and his children. The other—Zhinü, weeping, trapped forever in the heavens.</p>
      <p>Niulang reached out, but the waters roared between them.</p>
      <p>Zhinü called his name, but the river swallowed her voice.</p>
      <p>The sky was silent once more.</p>

      <h2>The Lovers’ Endless Sorrow</h2>
      <p><strong>The Stars That Watch Each Other Forever</strong></p>
      <p>Niulang stood at the edge of the Celestial River, gazing across the endless waters.</p>
      <p>Zhinü stood on the other side, her hands clutching her heart.</p>
      <p>They were so close—but would never touch again.</p>
      <p>From that moment forward, they became two lonely stars—</p>
      <p>✨ Altair (Niulang, the Cowherd).<br>
         ✨ Vega (Zhinü, the Weaver Girl).</p>
      <p>Every night, they burned brightly across the heavens, forever watching but never meeting.</p>
      <p>But even the gods were not without mercy.</p>
      <p>And soon, the magpies would come.</p>
