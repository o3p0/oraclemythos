      <h2>Setup – The Final Sacrifice</h2>
      <p><strong>The Underworld Has Fallen</strong></p>
  
      <p>The Lords of Xibalba were gone.</p>
  
      <p>Their thrones empty, their power broken.</p>
  
      <p>The underworld, once a place of fear and death, lay in ruins. The Hero Twins had done what no one before them could—they had defeated death itself.</p>
  
      <p>But their journey was not yet complete.</p>
  
      <p>"We have one final offering to make," Hunahpu said.</p>
  
      <p>Xbalanque nodded.</p>
  
      <p>They had given everything to win this battle—now, they would give themselves.</p>
  
      <p>They stepped into the flames, their bodies consumed by fire.</p>
  
      <p>Yet, even in death, their light did not fade.</p>

    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>Conflict – The Trial of the Sky</h2>
      <p><strong>The Twins Become Eternal</strong></p>
  
      <p>The flames did not destroy them.</p>
  
      <p>Instead, their spirits rose—higher than the mountains, higher than the clouds.</p>
  
      <p>The gods watched in awe.</p>
  
      <p>"They have conquered Xibalba," the Creator murmured. "But where shall they go now?"</p>
  
      <p>The winds carried their souls upward, weaving their essence into the heavens themselves.</p>
  
      <p>The twins had always been two halves of a whole—one of light, one of shadow.</p>
  
      <p>Now, the sky would reflect their bond forever.</p>
  
      <p>Hunahpu became the sun, blazing with the power of day.</p>
  
      <p>Xbalanque became the moon, glowing with the quiet strength of night.</p>
  
      <p>Together, they would watch over the world, bringing balance to life and death, light and darkness.</p>

    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>Resolution – The World Transformed</h2>
      <p><strong>A New Dawn Rises</strong></p>
  
      <p>For the first time, Xibalba was silent.</p>
  
      <p>The Lords of Death, once feared, had become nothing but whispers in the dark.</p>
  
      <p>And far above, the people looked up.</p>
  
      <p>Where once there had been only endless night, there was now the golden fire of the sun and the silver glow of the moon.</p>
  
      <p>The Hero Twins had fulfilled their destiny.</p>
  
      <p>Their game was over.</p>
  
      <p>But their light would never fade.</p>
  
      <p>And so, the cycle continued.</p>
  
      <p>The sun would rise.</p>
  
      <p>The moon would follow.</p>
  
      <p>And the story of the Hero Twins would live forever.</p>
