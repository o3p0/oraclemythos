      <h2>Setup – The Gods Shape the First Humans</h2>
      <p><strong>The Birth of Creation</strong></p>
  
      <p>Before the world had voices, before humans walked the earth, the gods gathered in the sky.</p>
  
      <p>The Heart of Sky (Huracan), the great storm god, stood with Sovereign Plumed Serpent, the wise creator.</p>
  
      <p>"The earth is made," said Sovereign Plumed Serpent. "The mountains rise, the rivers flow, and the sky stretches far."</p>
  
      <p>"Yet it is empty," murmured Heart of Sky, his thunderous voice echoing through the heavens. "We are not praised. Who will remember our names?"</p>
  
      <p>The gods turned to the earth below. They would craft beings to speak, to honor, to worship them.</p>
  
      <p>And so, they reached down and took the mud of the earth into their hands.</p>
  
      <p>They shaped the first humans, molding their bodies, smoothing their limbs.</p>
  
      <p>They breathed life into them.</p>
  
      <p>For a moment, all was still.</p>
  
      <p>The first humans opened their eyes.</p>
  
      <p>They rose, trembling, their limbs weak. Their skin was soft, damp, and fragile, crumbling at the slightest touch.</p>
  
      <p>And when they tried to speak, their voices were hollow, empty whispers, like the wind passing through reeds.</p>
  
      <p>The gods frowned.</p>
  
      <p>"They cannot stand strong," said Heart of Sky. "They melt away with the rain."</p>
  
      <p>"They do not hold wisdom," said Sovereign Plumed Serpent. "They cannot praise us."</p>
  
      <p>These were not the true people.</p>

      <h2>Conflict – A Flawed Creation</h2>
      <p><strong>The Mud People’s Fate</strong></p>
  
      <p>The mud people walked, but their steps were uncertain.</p>
  
      <p>They spoke, but their words were meaningless echoes, unable to form prayers or gratitude.</p>
  
      <p>They crumbled, dissolving back into the earth.</p>
  
      <p>"This is not the way," the gods decided. "They are weak, unfinished."</p>
  
      <p>The gods had wanted worshippers—beings who could honor them, who would offer maize and sing their names to the sky.</p>
  
      <p>But these creatures could not even hold themselves together.</p>
  
      <p>They were blind to the world, deaf to the gods.</p>
  
      <p>And so, with a single breath, the gods washed them away.</p>
  
      <p>The first humans were no more.</p>

      <h2>Resolution – The Search for a New Creation</h2>
      <p><strong>The Gods’ Work is Not Done</strong></p>
  
      <p>The earth remained silent.</p>
  
      <p>No voices called to the heavens.</p>
  
      <p>No hands built temples.</p>
  
      <p>No hearts beat with the fire of devotion.</p>
  
      <p>The gods stood above the world, watching.</p>
  
      <p>"This was only the first attempt," said Sovereign Plumed Serpent. "We will try again."</p>
  
      <p>"We will make them stronger," said Heart of Sky. "We will give them form that will last."</p>
  
      <p>But what material was worthy of creation?</p>
  
      <p>The gods turned to the trees, their roots deep in the soil, their bodies unyielding.</p>
  
      <p>"Perhaps wood will give them strength."</p>
  
      <p>And so, the gods reached for the trees of the world, preparing for their next creation.</p>
  
      <p>But strength without soul would bring a new disaster.</p>
