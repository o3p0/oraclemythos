      <h2>Setup â€“ The Weight of a Mistake</h2>
      <p><strong>Orunmilaâ€™s Wisdom & the Completion of Humanity</strong></p>
  
      <p>The land of Ile-Ife shimmered under the watchful sky, its rivers flowing, its trees swaying, its earth rich with promise. And yet, in the heart of creation, Obatala stood troubled.</p>
  
      <p>The humans he had shaped moved upon the land, their breath filled with life, but he could see itâ€”some walked with bent backs, some with missing limbs, some with uneven features.</p>
  
      <p>He knelt beside the river, gazing at his reflection in the water. The palm wine had clouded his hands, had made them careless. His creation was not as he had intended.</p>
  
      <p>"What have I done?" he murmured.</p>
  
      <p>His sorrow was great, yet he did not turn away. Instead, he sought Olodumare, the Supreme One, whispering a prayer carried upon the wind.</p>
  
      <p>Far above, in the celestial realm of Orun, Olodumare heard. With wisdom deeper than the oceans, he did not rebuke Obatala. Instead, he turned to Orunmila, the Orisha of wisdom and divination.</p>
  
      <p>"Go to the earth," Olodumare commanded. "Reveal to Obatala the truth of destiny. Let him see that all things are as they must be."</p>
  
      <p>And so, Orunmila prepared to descend, carrying with him the sacred IfÃ¡ divination board, upon which the fates of all things could be read.</p>

      <h2>Conflict & Action â€“ The Revelation of Ori</h2>
      <p><strong>The Revelation of Ori</strong></p>
  
      <p>Obatala sat beneath the great baobab tree, waiting. The winds shifted, the leaves trembled, and Orunmila appeared before him, stepping forth from the mist like a figure woven from the fabric of fate itself.</p>
  
      <p>He carried a wooden board, inscribed with sacred patterns. In his hands, he held palm nutsâ€”the keys to destiny.</p>
  
      <p>"You grieve for your creation," Orunmila spoke, his voice steady as the river.</p>
  
      <p>Obatala bowed his head. "They are imperfect. I have failed them."</p>
  
      <p>Orunmila knelt, placing the IfÃ¡ board upon the earth. He cast the sacred palm nuts, letting them fall into the dust.</p>
  
      <p>The markings they formed spoke a truth that had been hidden until now.</p>
  
      <p>"You shaped their bodies, Obatala," Orunmila said, "but their souls were shaped before birth. Each human has an Oriâ€”a destiny chosen before they enter the world. No being is flawed. No form is mistaken. Each path is different, but all are sacred."</p>
  
      <p>Obatalaâ€™s breath caught in his throat. "Then my mistakeâ€¦"</p>
  
      <p>"Was never a mistake." Orunmilaâ€™s gaze held the weight of eternity. "Only Olodumare knows the full design of the world. You were chosen to create, but creation itself carries mysteries even the gods cannot always see."</p>

      <h2>Resolution & Cliffhanger â€“ Obatalaâ€™s Redemption & the Promise</h2>
      <p><strong>Obatalaâ€™s Redemption & the Promise</strong></p>
  
      <p>Obatala rose to his feet, his sorrow lifting like mist before the morning sun. He turned toward the humansâ€”the ones with strong limbs and the ones with twisted forms, the ones who walked tall and the ones who struggled.</p>
  
      <p>He stepped forward, touching the head of a child whose legs were uneven. Then he placed his hands on an elder with eyes clouded by darkness.</p>
  
      <p>"You are whole," he said to them. "You are sacred. You are mine."</p>
  
      <p>He turned to Orunmila. "Then I will not turn away from them. If each being has a path, then I will walk beside those whom the world does not understand. I will be the protector of the ones born different. They shall never be cast aside."</p>
  
      <p>The wind stirred, carrying his vow to the heavens. And Olodumare heard.</p>
  
      <p>A voice, vast as the sky, whispered through the trees:</p>
  
      <p>"So it shall be."</p>
  
      <p>And thus, Obatala became the patron of those who were different, the guardian of those with disabilities, the god who loved all his children without judgment.</p>
  
      <p>Far above, Orunmila lifted his divination board, his task complete. He turned back to the heavens, leaving behind the sacred knowledge of IfÃ¡ divination, which would guide humanity forever.</p>
  
      <p>Yet, though the land was formed, though humans now walked upon it, one thing was still missing.</p>
  
      <p>The world was silent. No song, no laughter, no voice of the divine. The breath of life had yet to be given.</p>
