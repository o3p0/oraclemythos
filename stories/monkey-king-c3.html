      <h2>The Trick of the Jade Emperor</h2>
      <p><strong>A Throne in the Heavens or a Leash?</strong></p>
      <p>The Jade Emperor (玉皇大帝) sat upon his celestial throne, his gaze fixed upon the mortal world.</p>
      <p>The Monkey King had declared himself “Great Sage Equal to Heaven (齐天大圣),” yet he had never set foot in Heaven.</p>
      <p>"Arrogance must be guided," the Emperor mused. "If we cannot tame the beast by force, then let us tame him with illusion."</p>
      <p>So, a royal decree descended upon Flower-Fruit Mountain (花果山).</p>
      <p>🌿✨ Sun Wukong was “invited” to Heaven. ✨🌿</p>
      <p>A golden chariot, drawn by celestial dragons, arrived to escort him.</p>
      <p>The Monkey King grinned. "Ah, so they finally recognize my greatness."</p>
      <p>But his title? Stablemaster of the Celestial Horses (弼马温).</p>
      <p>👑 Not a lord. Not a sage. Just a caretaker of divine beasts.</p>
      <p>At first, he enjoyed the glories of Heaven—but when he overheard the gods mocking him, his fury erupted like a volcano.</p>
      <p>🔥 He stormed out of the stables, ripped off his robes, and returned to Flower-Fruit Mountain. 🔥</p>
      <p>🔥 If they would not respect him—then he would take his throne by force. 🔥</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>The War Begins</h2>
      <p><strong>The Army of Heaven vs. The Great Sage Equal to Heaven</strong></p>
      <p>Upon his return, Sun Wukong carved his title into stone:</p>
      <p>✨ “Great Sage Equal to Heaven” (齐天大圣) – The One Above All But the Jade Emperor. ✨</p>
      <p>The gods laughed—until the sky shook with his defiance.</p>
      <p>🌩 A heavenly army of 100,000 was assembled, led by the Four Heavenly Kings (四大天王).</p>
      <p>⚔️ The battle began and raged for 49 days. ⚔️</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔹 Divine spears clashed against enchanted fur.</li>
        <li>🔹 Heavenly warriors fell beneath the golden staff.</li>
        <li>🔹 Even thunder and fire could not break him.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>🌪 He transformed into a giant. 🔥 He multiplied into hundreds. ⚡ He laughed as gods fled.</p>
      <p>The Jade Emperor trembled. "Call upon Erlang Shen (二郎神)."</p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>The Duel of Legends</h2>
      <p><strong>Sun Wukong vs. Erlang Shen</strong></p>
      <p>The battlefield hushed as Erlang Shen arrived.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🌙 A third eye glowing.</li>
        <li>⚔️ A divine spear in hand.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sun Wukong smiled. "Finally, a real challenge."</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🐉 Wukong became a dragon – Erlang a storm.</li>
        <li>🦅 Wukong a phoenix – Erlang lightning.</li>
        <li>🦢 Wukong a fish – Erlang an eagle.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But then—Wukong became a temple, hoping Erlang would not strike sacred ground.</p>
      <p>⚡ Erlang saw through it. One blow shattered the illusion.</p>
      <p>🔥 Laozi’s Golden Elixir Furnace (八卦炉) was opened.</p>
      <p>🔥 Sun Wukong was thrown inside, sealed beneath roaring flames.</p>
      <p>But he had eaten the Peaches of Immortality. He had drunk the Elixir.</p>
      <p>🔥 The fire could not destroy him. It only made him stronger. 🔥</p>
      <p>When the doors opened—</p>
      <p>🌩 The Monkey King stepped out, untouched. 🌩</p>
      <p>"Now I am truly invincible."</p>
      <p>The Jade Emperor sent word to the Western Paradise—</p>
      <p><em>“Beg Buddha for help.”</em></p>
      <p><em>—To be continued in Chapter 4: The Great Battle in the Heavens.</em></p>
