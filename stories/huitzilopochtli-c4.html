      <h2>Setup â€“ The War That Never Ends</h2>
      <p><strong>The Sun Rises, But the Darkness Remains</strong></p>
      <p>The battle was over.</p>
      <p>Huitzilopochtli stood alone upon Coatepec, the Serpent Mountain.</p>
      <p>The earth was slick with the blood of the fallenâ€”Coyolxauhqui lay dismembered, her head cast into the sky, now the pale, defeated moon. The 400 brothers were slain, their bodies scattered across the heavens, their flames now cold, distant stars.</p>
      <p>ðŸ”¥ The sun had triumphed. ðŸ”¥</p>
      <p>But Huitzilopochtli knew this was not the end.</p>
      <p>The stars had not disappeared. They had only retreated.</p>
      <p>"The war will never end."</p>
      <p>Every night, the stars would rise again. Every morning, the sun must rise to meet them, cutting them down once more.</p>

      <h2>Conflict â€“ The Price of Victory</h2>
      <p><strong>The Sun Must Be Fed</strong></p>
      <p>The gods looked down from the heavens.</p>
      <p>Huitzilopochtli had proven himself the mightiest warriorâ€”The Sun had risen, and darkness had fallen.</p>
      <p>But they saw what he sawâ€”The battle would always return.</p>
      <p>"He cannot fight alone," the gods decreed. "He must be given strength."</p>
      <p>And so, they made a final law:</p>
      <p>"The Sun will rise, but only if it is fed."</p>
      <p>"The blood of warriors will nourish Huitzilopochtli, so he may battle the night."</p>
      <p>With obsidian blades, they cut open their own hearts, offering their blood to the sun.</p>
      <p>ðŸ”¥ The earth drank the sacrifice. The sun burned brighter. ðŸ”¥</p>
      <p>And so, the cycle was set.</p>
      <p>The Aztecs understood: The sun moves because we feed it.</p>

      <h2>Resolution â€“ The Legacy of the Sun</h2>
      <p><strong>The Birth of a Warrior Nation</strong></p>
      <p>The Aztecs built their greatest temples in Huitzilopochtliâ€™s honor.</p>
      <p>Upon the Templo Mayor in TenochtitlÃ¡n, they carved Coyolxauhquiâ€™s shattered body into stoneâ€”a warning to all who opposed the Sun.</p>
      <p>ðŸ”¥ They became warriors. They waged war not just for land, but for the survival of the cosmos. ðŸ”¥</p>
      <p>They captured enemies not to conquer, but to offer them to the Sun.</p>
      <p>"Without sacrifice, the sun will die."</p>
      <p>And so, they fought.</p>
      <p>Every dawn was a victory. Every sunset was a threat. Every drop of blood was a promiseâ€”</p>
      <p>ðŸ”¥ The Sun will rise again. ðŸ”¥</p>
      <p><em>â€”The End.</em></p>
