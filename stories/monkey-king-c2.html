      <h2>The Monkey King’s Restless Soul</h2>
      <p><strong>A Ruler Who Craves More</strong></p>
      <p>Sun Wukong had everything.</p>
      <p>🏯 A kingdom hidden behind the Water Curtain Cave.<br>🦧 A loyal army of monkeys who worshiped him as their leader.<br>🍑 A paradise of fruit-laden trees, endless feasts, and wild freedom.</p>
      <p>And yet, it was not enough.</p>
      <p>As he sat upon his stone throne, watching the waves crash beyond the cliffs, he felt a deep unease—a hunger that no fruit could satisfy.</p>
      <p>"All things under heaven change," he mused. "Even mountains crumble, rivers dry, and kings fall. What power lasts forever?"</p>
      <p>Then, the answer came to him—immortality.</p>
      <p>If even the gods could live beyond time, why should he be any less?</p>
      <p>And so, he left his kingdom, vowing to seek a way to escape death itself.</p>

      <h2> Stealing the Secrets of Immortality</h2>
      <p><strong>The Monkey Who Would Not Die</strong></p>
      <p>Sun Wukong wandered the world, crossing rivers, forests, and mountains in search of wisdom.</p>
      <p>He climbed the Spirit Terrace Mountain (灵台方寸山), where he found a Daoist master: Patriarch Subhuti (须菩提祖师).</p>
      <p>For years, he trained in secret, mastering:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔹 The 72 Transformations (七十二变)</li>
        <li>🔹 The Cloud Somersault (筋斗云)</li>
        <li>🔹 Mind-Control & Immortal Arts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But knowledge alone was not enough. True immortality still eluded him.</p>
      <p>So he took matters into his own hands:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔥 He snuck into the Underworld and erased his name from the Book of Life and Death.</li>
        <li>🔥 He descended into the Dragon King’s palace and stole his legendary weapon—the Golden-Banded Staff (如意金箍棒).</li>
        <li>🔥 He fought the celestial guardians and devoured the Peaches of Immortality.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>No longer just a king of monkeys, he had become something more—something untouchable.</p>
      <p>Sun Wukong was now beyond death, beyond control.</p>
      <p>And yet, he was not satisfied.</p>
      <p>If he could be so powerful, why should heaven rule over him?</p>

      <h2> The Monkey Declares War on the Gods</h2>
      <p><strong>A New Title, A New Defiance</strong></p>
      <p>With his immortal body and unstoppable strength, Sun Wukong stood before his followers.</p>
      <p>🔥 “From this day forward, I am no mere king,” he declared.<br>🔥 “I am the Great Sage Equal to Heaven (齐天大圣)!”</p>
      <p>The heavens shook at his arrogance.</p>
      <p>From the celestial palaces, the Jade Emperor (玉皇大帝) frowned.</p>
      <p>A mortal-born beast had defied the cosmic order.</p>
      <p>🚨 This could not be ignored. 🚨</p>
      <p>Thus, heaven devised a plan: to lure him in, to bind him from within.</p>
      <p>A celestial decree was sent—an invitation to the halls of heaven itself.</p>
      <p>Sun Wukong smiled.</p>
      <p>If they sought to control him, they would soon regret it.</p>
