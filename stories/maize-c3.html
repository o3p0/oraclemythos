      <h2>Setup ‚Äì The Search for the Perfect Creation</h2>
      <p><strong>The Gods Turn to Maize</strong></p>
  
      <p>The Mud People had crumbled.<br>
      The Wooden People had no soul.</p>
  
      <p>Twice, the gods had failed.</p>
  
      <p>But Heart of Sky (Huracan) and Sovereign Plumed Serpent would not stop.</p>
  
      <p>"There must be something greater," Sovereign Plumed Serpent said.<br>
      "Something strong, yet wise‚Ä¶ something that remembers us."</p>
  
      <p>So they searched the world for a material worthy of life.</p>
  
      <p>They looked to the mountains‚Äîbut stone was too cold, too lifeless.<br>
      They looked to the rivers‚Äîbut water was too fluid, too fleeting.</p>
  
      <p>Then, they turned to the fields, where golden stalks swayed in the wind.</p>
  
      <p>And there, they found it.</p>
  
      <p>Maize.</p>
  
      <p>"This is the essence of life," the gods declared.<br>
      "From maize, we will shape the true people."</p>
  
      <p>And so, they took the kernels of maize in their hands and began their greatest creation.</p>

      <h2>Conflict ‚Äì The Birth of the First True Humans</h2>
      <p><strong>The People of Corn Rise</strong></p>
  
      <p>The gods ground the maize into a fine meal, mixing it with sacred water.</p>
  
      <p>They molded bodies, strong and whole.</p>
  
      <p>They shaped hands to build, minds to think, hearts to feel.</p>
  
      <p>And when they were finished, they breathed life into them.</p>
  
      <p>The first humans opened their eyes.</p>
  
      <p>They stood tall and unshaken.<br>
      They spoke with wisdom and gratitude.<br>
      They lifted their faces to the sky and said, "We know you."</p>
  
      <p>And for the first time, the gods smiled.</p>
  
      <p>These were not creatures of mud or wood.</p>
  
      <p>These were the true people‚Äîthe first of the Maya.</p>
  
      <p>The gods gave them names:<br>
      üåì Jaguar Quitze<br>
      üåë Jaguar Night<br>
      ‚òÄÔ∏è Not Right Now<br>
      üî• Dark Jaguar</p>
  
      <p>They were the fathers of humanity.</p>
  
      <p>And from them, the Maya people would be born.</p>

      <h2>Resolution ‚Äì The Gift and the Limit</h2>
      <p><strong>The Gods Humble Their Creation</strong></p>
  
      <p>The first humans were perfect.</p>
  
      <p>Too perfect.</p>
  
      <p>Their vision stretched beyond mountains, beyond stars.<br>
      They could see across time, across the heavens.</p>
  
      <p>The gods grew uneasy.</p>
  
      <p>"They see as we do," said Heart of Sky. "They are nearly gods themselves."</p>
  
      <p>"We must limit them," said Sovereign Plumed Serpent. "Lest they forget they are mortal."</p>
  
      <p>And so, the gods breathed upon their eyes‚Äînot to blind them, but to cloud their vision.</p>
  
      <p>The humans could still see, still understand, still build.</p>
  
      <p>But they would no longer know all.</p>
  
      <p>They would no longer be gods.</p>
  
      <p>The gods were pleased.</p>
  
      <p>They gave humanity a final gift‚Äîmaize, their very essence.</p>
  
      <p>"This is your blood," the gods declared. "This is your life. Cherish it, for it will sustain you, as you will sustain us."</p>
  
      <p>And so, the Maya were born.</p>
  
      <p>From the fields of the gods, maize became flesh.<br>
      From the breath of the sky, wisdom became life.</p>
  
      <p>And the cycle of creation was complete.</p>
