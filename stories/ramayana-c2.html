      <h2>The Call to Adventure</h2>
      <p><strong>The Golden Trap</strong></p>
  
      <p>The forest of Panchavati was alive with whispers of rustling leaves and the murmurs of unseen watchers. It had become home to Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana—a place of quiet exile where even the sun wove golden patterns through the trees as if paying homage to the prince of Ayodhya.</p>
  
      <p>But peace is a fragile thing. And fate does not sleep.</p>
  
      <p>From the thickets emerged a golden deer, its body shimmering as if woven from sunlight itself. It moved with unnatural grace, its eyes deep and knowing, as if hiding a secret within their liquid depths.</p>
  
      <p>Sita’s breath caught. "Rama, look! Have you ever seen such beauty?"</p>
  
      <p>Rama studied the creature, but Lakshmana’s brow furrowed with suspicion. "Brother, this is no ordinary deer. I sense deception."</p>
  
      <p>But Sita, entranced, turned to Rama, her voice soft yet insistent. "Please, capture it for me. I have never asked for anything in this forest, but this…"</p>
  
      <p>Rama, bound by love, smiled and took up his bow. "Then I shall bring it to you, my love."</p>
  
      <p>Lakshmana, still uneasy, warned, "If you must go, take caution. I fear this is a trap."</p>
  
      <p>Rama nodded, his eyes sharp as he disappeared into the emerald depths of the forest. The golden deer, its shimmering form flitting between the trees, led him deeper and deeper into the unknown.</p>
  
      <p>Then—a cry split the air.</p>
  
      <p>"Lakshmana! Sita!"</p>
  
      <p>It was Rama’s voice—desperate, pained.</p>
  
      <p>Sita turned pale. "He is in danger! Go to him, Lakshmana!"</p>
  
      <p>Lakshmana hesitated. "No. My brother is invincible. He would never call for help unless—"</p>
  
      <p>"Go!" Sita pleaded, her voice edged with fear. "If you love him, you will not delay!"</p>
  
      <p>Reluctantly, Lakshmana drew his sword and traced a glowing line around the ashram. The air shimmered as the Lakshmana Rekha—a barrier of protection—sealed Sita within.</p>
  
      <p>"Do not cross this line, my lady," he warned. "No harm can reach you here."</p>
  
      <p>Then, he turned and ran toward Rama’s cries, leaving Sita alone.</p>
  
      <p>In the stillness, a shadow moved.</p>

    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p><strong>The Deceiver at the Door</strong></p>
  
      <p>A frail figure emerged from the trees—an old ascetic, clad in saffron robes, his body bent with age, his eyes deep with false wisdom. He leaned upon a staff, stepping toward the ashram’s entrance.</p>
  
      <p>"O noble lady," he rasped, "I have wandered far and have not eaten. Would you grant this humble sage a little food?"</p>
  
      <p>Sita, ever kind, stepped forward, but the Lakshmana Rekha held her back.</p>
  
      <p>She hesitated. She had never turned away a guest in need, yet Lakshmana’s warning echoed in her mind.</p>
  
      <p>"Please, Devi," the old man whispered, his voice turning sorrowful, "will you deny an ascetic his alms?"</p>
  
      <p>Compassion overcame caution.</p>
  
      <p>With a single step beyond the Lakshmana Rekha, the air shattered like broken glass. The illusion dissolved, and before Sita could even gasp, the sage’s form twisted, expanded—robes bursting into dark silk, a crown of ten heads rising like storm clouds.</p>
  
      <p>Before her stood Ravana, the demon king of Lanka.</p>
  
      <p>"At last, the jewel of Ayodhya stands before me," he said, his voice rich with triumph. "No longer shall you waste away in exile. You were meant to sit upon a throne beside me, not in the dust of the wilderness."</p>
  
      <p>Sita’s hands clenched into fists. "I belong to Rama. No power in heaven or earth will change that."</p>
  
      <p>Ravana’s smile turned cruel.</p>
  
      <p>"Then I shall take you to where even the gods cannot hear your cries."</p>
  
      <p>In a single motion, he seized her, and the skies themselves seemed to recoil in horror.</p>

      <h2>The Payoff</h2>
      <p><strong>The Sky Shudders, The Earth Weeps</strong></p>
  
      <p>As Ravana ascended into the heavens upon his golden Pushpaka Vimana, Sita’s voice split the air like thunder.</p>
  
      <p>"Rama! Lakshmana!"</p>
  
      <p>The trees groaned. The rivers raged. But there was no answer.</p>
  
      <p>Yet she was not alone in her suffering.</p>
  
      <p>Through the clouds, a great shadow swooped down—Jatayu, the mighty eagle, guardian of dharma. His wings darkened the sun, his talons gleamed like lightning.</p>
  
      <p>"Demon king!" he roared. "You will go no further!"</p>
  
      <p>Ravana laughed. "Old bird, you seek death?"</p>
  
      <p>With a cry that shook the sky, Jatayu struck. His claws tore through the chariot’s golden beams, sending it lurching through the storm-tossed winds. He lashed out, his beak aimed for Ravana’s black heart.</p>
  
      <p>But Ravana, furious, drew his sword—Chandrahas, the blade blessed by Shiva himself. With one terrible strike, the demon king slashed through Jatayu’s wings.</p>
  
      <p>The great eagle plummeted, his body crashing into the forest below.</p>
  
      <p>Sita’s cries faded into the distance as the chariot sped away, disappearing beyond the horizon.</p>
  
      <p>Far below, Jatayu lay dying, his breath ragged, his eyes dimming. But his purpose was not yet complete.</p>
  
      <p>For Rama would come. And when he did, the world would tremble.</p>
