      <h2>The Journey & A Hidden Threat</h2>
      <p><strong>🐵💔 A warrior’s strength is not just in battle—but in trust. Can the Monkey King prove his devotion?</strong></p>
  
      <p>The morning air was crisp, the sun casting golden light upon the mountain path. 🌄🌿</p>
  
      <p>🚶 Tang Sanzang led the way, his heart light with newfound trust in his disciple.<br>
      🐵 Sun Wukong followed, his staff resting on his shoulder.</p>
  
      <p>Though the sting of the Golden Headband still lingered from their last battle, he had kept his temper in check. He had done well.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "See, Master? I can behave," he boasted, flashing a sharp-toothed grin.</p>
  
      <p>🙏 Tang Sanzang chuckled.<br>
      🙏 "Perhaps, Wukong. But wisdom is not proven in one day."</p>
  
      <p>🌫️ The fog thickened around them. The trees whispered as the wind carried unseen words.</p>
  
      <p>🐍 A dark force slithered through the shadows.</p>
  
      <p>She had been watching.<br>
      She had been waiting.</p>
  
      <p>👹 The White Bone Demon (白骨精, Baigujing).</p>
  
      <p>A spirit of deception. A master of illusion.<br>
      And she had one goal: To drive a wedge between the monk and his protector.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>A Deadly Trick & Betrayal</h2>
  
      <p>👹 "A brute cannot be trusted," she mused, her lips curling into a cruel smile.<br>
      👹 "Let me show this monk what truly lurks behind the monkey’s mask."</p>
  
      <p>⚡ She transformed—into a weak, human woman.<br>
      ⚡ She stumbled onto the path, feigning fear.</p>
  
      <p>🗣️ "Oh, kind travelers! Please, help me!" she cried, her voice trembling.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Sun Wukong’s golden eyes narrowed.<br>
      🐵 "Master, step back."</p>
  
      <p>🙏 Tang Sanzang frowned.<br>
      🙏 "Wukong, she is but a woman in need."</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "No, she is not."</p>
  
      <p>👹 The demon-woman fell to her knees, clutching Tang Sanzang’s robes.<br>
      👹 "He lies! He is a beast, not a protector!"</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Wukong’s grip tightened on his staff.<br>
      🐵 "Enough!"</p>
  
      <p>⚡ With one strike—he ended her life.</p>
  
      <p>🌬️ Her body vanished into the wind. Bones clattered to the ground.</p>
  
      <p>👀 Tang Sanzang’s eyes widened in horror.</p>
  
      <p>🙏 "Wukong… you have killed a human."</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "No, Master! She was a demon!"</p>
  
      <p>🙏 "I saw only a woman begging for mercy."</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "You don’t understand—!"</p>
  
      <p>🗣️ "Monster!" a voice called from the trees.</p>
  
      <p>👹 The White Bone Demon appeared again—this time, as an old man.</p>
  
      <p>👴 "He struck down my daughter without reason!"</p>
  
      <p>🌿 The forest whispered with accusations.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "Lies!" Wukong snarled. "I can see through you!"</p>
  
      <p>⚡ He struck again—and again, the demon vanished.</p>
  
      <p>🌪️ And yet, she returned. Again. And again.</p>
  
      <p>👹 The villagers’ voices rose.<br>
      🗣️ "A killer! A monster!"</p>
  
      <p>🙏 Tang Sanzang’s heart ached. He turned to his disciple.</p>
  
      <p>🙏 "Wukong, I can no longer trust you."</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Sun Wukong’s breath caught.</p>
  
      <p>🙏 "I release you from my service."</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "Master—NO!"</p>
  
      <p>🔥 The sutra was spoken. The Golden Headband tightened.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Pain burned through his skull.</p>
  
      <p>⚡ With one final cry—Sun Wukong fled.</p>

      <h2>The Return & Redemption</h2>
  
      <p>🌑 The night was long.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Alone, atop a desolate peak, Sun Wukong sat in silence.</p>
  
      <p>💭 Betrayed. Rejected. Cast aside.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "After all I’ve done… after all I’ve endured… he still doesn’t trust me?"</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "Why did I ever try?"</p>
  
      <p>💨 The wind howled through the cliffs.</p>
  
      <p>🐉 A voice whispered in the night.</p>
  
      <p>🗣️ "And yet, you are still watching him."</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Wukong turned. A great dragon stood before him.</p>
  
      <p>🐉 "If you truly did not care, would you still be here?"</p>
  
      <p>🔥 Wukong clenched his fists. He hated the truth in those words.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "I swore to protect him."<br>
      🐵 "I will do so—whether he wants me or not."</p>
  
      <p>⚔️ A distant scream pierced the night.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 His master was in danger.</p>
  
      <p>⚡ Without hesitation, Sun Wukong soared through the sky—racing toward the battle.</p>
  
      <p>👹 The White Bone Demon loomed over Tang Sanzang, her fangs bared.<br>
      👹 "Now, monk… you are truly alone."</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "Not while I stand!"</p>
  
      <p>⚡ Sun Wukong struck with all his fury.</p>
  
      <p>🔥 This time, the demon did not return.</p>
  
      <p>🌿 The forest fell silent.</p>
  
      <p>🙏 Tang Sanzang, trembling, looked up at his disciple.</p>
  
      <p>🙏 "You came back."</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "I never left."</p>
  
      <p>🌅 As dawn rose, a new bond was forged.</p>
  
      <p>🔥 Not through loyalty alone—but through forgiveness.</p>
