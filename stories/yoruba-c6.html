      <h2>Setup ‚Äì The Gift of Ori</h2>
      <p><strong>The Journey of Ori ‚Äì The Fate of Mankind</strong></p>
  
      <p>The land and sea had found balance. Ile-Ife flourished, rivers winding through fertile soil, trees heavy with fruit. The first humans walked the earth, shaped by Obatala‚Äôs hands, each carrying the breath of Olodumare.</p>
  
      <p>Yet, something was missing.</p>
  
      <p>Though their bodies were formed, their destinies remained unknown. Their minds wandered, uncertain of their purpose. They gazed at the sky, questioning their place in the world.</p>
  
      <p>High in Orun, the celestial realm, Olodumare summoned Orunmila, the Orisha of wisdom and fate.</p>
  
      <p>"The world is complete," Olodumare spoke, his voice vast as the heavens. "But these beings do not yet know their paths. Go to Ajala, the Potter of Destinies. Let them choose their Ori‚Äîtheir fate."</p>
  
      <p>Orunmila bowed and descended to the realm of Ajala, where all human destinies were shaped.</p>

      <h2>Conflict & Action ‚Äì Choosing a Destiny</h2>
      <p><strong>Choosing a Destiny</strong></p>
  
      <p>In a realm beyond time, Ajala the Potter shaped destinies from sacred clay. Each Ori (soul destiny) was molded, holding a person's fortune‚Äîsome filled with prosperity, others with hardship.</p>
  
      <p>Orunmila stood before Ajala‚Äôs workshop, watching as the first humans arrived, guided by unseen hands.</p>
  
      <p>One by one, they reached into the sacred vessel and chose their Ori. Some rejoiced, feeling a warmth of fortune. Others trembled, sensing struggles ahead.</p>
  
      <p>But not all Ori were whole.</p>
  
      <p>Some, rushed in their creation, were flawed‚Äîcracked, fragile, or incomplete. Those who unknowingly picked these would face trials, their lives filled with struggle.</p>
  
      <p>A man cried out, "Why must some suffer while others thrive?"</p>
  
      <p>Orunmila, ever wise, answered, "Ori is choice and destiny, woven together. No fate is without hardship, and no hardship is without wisdom."</p>
  
      <p>The people carried their Ori back to Ile-Ife, some filled with joy, others with fear. Their journeys had begun.</p>

      <h2>Resolution & Cliffhanger ‚Äì The Test of Free Will</h2>
      <p><strong>The Test of Free Will</strong></p>
  
      <p>Back on earth, the first humans faced the weight of their destinies. Some prospered, their crops abundant, their hearts light. Others struggled, their feet heavy with misfortune.</p>
  
      <p>Many returned to the sacred grove, crying out, "Can our fate be changed?"</p>
  
      <p>Orunmila stood before them, his gaze deep with knowing.</p>
  
      <p>"Destiny is not stone," he said, "but water. It flows, it bends, it carves new paths. Pray, act, seek wisdom‚ÄîOri will guide you."</p>
  
      <p>The first humans listened, and a new truth settled upon them: Though fate was chosen, free will remained.</p>
  
      <p>Above, Olodumare watched, the fabric of creation now complete. The world would move by fate and by choice, forever intertwined.</p>
  
      <p>And so, humanity walked forward, carrying their Ori, shaping the world as the gods watched, waiting.</p>
