            <h2>The Final Battle Begins</h2>
            <p><strong>"The sky splits. The earth burns. The gods ride to their doom, not in fear, but in defiance."</strong></p>
            <p>The Nine Realms trembled. The Bifröst, the Rainbow Bridge, shattered beneath the weight of Loki’s army—giants from Jotunheim, the dead from Helheim, and monstrous creatures born from chaos. The sky burned with ash and flame, and the oceans boiled as Jörmungandr, the World Serpent, coiled its massive body around Midgard, poisoning land and sea alike.</p>
            <p>In Asgard, the gods stood ready—not with hope, but with honor. Odin, clad in golden armor, rode his eight-legged steed Sleipnir, his spear Gungnir gleaming like a shard of fate itself. By his side were the gods of thunder, war, and wisdom—Thor, Týr, Freyr, and countless others, their eyes filled with the knowledge of what was to come.</p>
            <p>They knew this was not a battle they could win. Ragnarök was not a war to be prevented. It was the fulfillment of prophecy—the final act of a story carved into the bones of Yggdrasil itself.</p>
            <p>But the gods would fight. Not because they believed they could escape their doom, but because facing it was their purpose.</p>

            <h2>The Gods Fall</h2>
            <p><strong>"Destiny is not a path to walk—it is a storm to stand against."</strong></p>
            <p>The clash was cataclysmic. The sound of steel against bone, the roar of beasts, and the cries of the dying echoed across the cosmos.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Odin vs. Fenrir:</strong> The Allfather rode into battle, charging straight at Fenrir, the monstrous wolf fated to devour him. They met with earth-shaking fury. Odin’s spear struck true, but Fenrir’s hunger was greater than any weapon. The beast swallowed Odin whole, fulfilling the prophecy. Yet Odin’s death was not in vain—his son Víðarr, the silent god of vengeance, leapt forward, driving his boot into Fenrir’s jaw, tearing the wolf’s mouth apart with divine strength, avenging his father.</li>
                <li><strong>Thor vs. Jörmungandr:</strong> Thor, god of thunder, faced his eternal foe, the World Serpent. Mjölnir met venomous fangs, and the battle raged with such fury that the earth itself split. Thor struck the killing blow, crushing Jörmungandr’s skull. But victory was fleeting—poison filled his lungs, and after nine steps, the god of thunder collapsed, lifeless beside his slain enemy.</li>
                <li><strong>Týr vs. Garm:</strong> The one-handed god of war, Týr, fought Garm, the monstrous hound guarding Hel’s gates. Their duel was fierce and bloody, each inflicting mortal wounds upon the other. Týr’s honor held strong even as he fell, his final breath mingling with the beast’s dying snarl.</li>
                <li><strong>Freyr vs. Surtr:</strong> Freyr, god of fertility and peace, faced the fire giant Surtr, who wielded a flaming sword brighter than the sun. Freyr fought valiantly but without his magical sword, having given it away long ago. Surtr struck him down, and with Freyr’s fall, Surtr unleashed his wrath, setting the world ablaze.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The flames consumed everything—realms, gods, monsters, and men. The oceans swallowed the land, and the sky collapsed. Even Yggdrasil shuddered, its roots scorched, its branches cracked.</p>

            <h2>A Seed Beyond the Ashes</h2>
            <p><strong>"The end is not the end. It is the space between breaths—the silence before the next song begins."</strong></p>
            <p>As the fires of Ragnarök faded, only silence remained. The gods were gone. The great beasts lay dead. The Nine Realms were ash and ruin.</p>
            <p>But even in the deepest darkness, life endured.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>From the ashes, Víðarr and Váli, sons of Odin, emerged—survivors of the final battle.</li>
                <li>Magni and Móði, sons of Thor, rose as well, carrying their father’s hammer, Mjölnir, a symbol that not all strength had perished.</li>
                <li>Hidden in the branches of Yggdrasil, two humans, Líf and Lífthrasir, emerged, having survived the flames and frost. They would be the seed of humanity’s rebirth.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The world slowly began to heal. The sun, once devoured, rose again—reborn as the daughter of the old sun, casting light upon the new world. Rivers flowed clear, forests grew, and the echoes of the old gods faded into legend.</p>
            <p>And beneath it all, Yggdrasil stood—not unscarred, but unbroken. Its roots still deep, its branches reaching toward new skies.</p>
            <p>—Thus ends the tale of Ragnarök, and thus begins the world anew.</p>
