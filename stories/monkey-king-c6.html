      <h2>Setup – The Journey Begins & A Dark Presence Looms</h2>
      <p><strong>🐵⚡ A protector must be more than a warrior. But can the Monkey King learn restraint?</strong></p>
  
      <p>The road stretched before them, winding through valleys of mist and ancient trees. 🌿🏯</p>
  
      <p>🚶 Tang Sanzang walked ahead, his robes flowing like water.<br>
      🐵 Sun Wukong followed, his golden eyes scanning the shadows.</p>
  
      <p>For the first time in centuries, the Monkey King was free.<br>
      Yet, the weight of the Golden Headband (金箍咒) lingered on his brow.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "Master," Wukong said, swinging his staff over his shoulder. "We’ve been walking for days. When do I get to fight?"</p>
  
      <p>🌿 Tang Sanzang smiled.<br>
      🙏 "Our journey is not about fighting, Wukong. It is about enlightenment."</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Wukong snorted.<br>
      🐵 "Tch. Enlightenment won’t protect you from demons."</p>
  
      <p>🌫️ And as if summoned by his words, the air grew heavy.<br>
      A foul wind swept through the forest. The trees shuddered.</p>
  
      <p>From the shadows, a monstrous figure emerged—tall, draped in yellow robes, its face twisted with malice.</p>
  
      <p>👹 The Yellow-Robed Demon (黄袍怪).<br>
      🔥 A spirit of hunger and vengeance, long forgotten by the heavens.</p>
  
      <p>🗣️ "A monk walks unguarded?" the demon sneered.<br>
      🗣️ "Fortune smiles upon me. Your flesh will make a fine meal."</p>
  
      <p>🔥 Sun Wukong stepped forward, his grip tightening on his staff.<br>
      🐵 "You picked the wrong monk, demon."</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>Conflict – A Battle of Power & Restraint</h2>
  
      <p>⚔️ The demon lunged!</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Wukong met him in an instant—staff colliding with claws.<br>
      ⚡ The earth shook beneath them. Trees splintered. The air crackled with fury.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "Is that all?" Wukong taunted, somersaulting through the air.<br>
      👹 "Arrogant beast!" the demon snarled, hurling a wave of dark fire.</p>
  
      <p>🔥 Wukong spun his Golden-Banded Staff (如意金箍棒), dispersing the flames.</p>
  
      <p>He grinned.<br>
      🐵 "I could end this in one blow."</p>
  
      <p>And he did.</p>
  
      <p>⚡ With a single strike, Wukong shattered the demon’s ribs.<br>
      ⚡ The spirit collapsed, gasping.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Wukong stood over him, raising his staff for the final blow.</p>
  
      <p>👹 "Mercy—!" the demon croaked.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 But Wukong’s eyes burned with fury.<br>
      🐵 "Demons deserve no mercy."</p>
  
      <p>He swung down.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="chapter-section fade-in">
      <h2>Resolution – The Pain of the Golden Headband</h2>
  
      <p>⚡ Pain exploded through Wukong’s skull.</p>
  
      <p>🔥 The Golden Headband tightened!<br>
      🔥 The fire of a thousand needles burned through his mind.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "AGH!" Wukong staggered, clutching his head.</p>
  
      <p>🌿 Tang Sanzang spoke softly.<br>
      🙏 "Enough, Wukong."</p>
  
      <p>🐵 "He is a demon!" Wukong snarled through clenched teeth.<br>
      🐵 "He would have killed you!"</p>
  
      <p>🙏 "Perhaps. But if we kill without wisdom, we become no better than them."</p>
  
      <p>🌿 Tang Sanzang stepped forward.</p>
  
      <p>The demon, wheezing in pain, crawled away and vanished into the mist.</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Wukong fumed.<br>
      🐵 "You let him escape!"</p>
  
      <p>🌿 Tang Sanzang looked at him with calm eyes.<br>
      🙏 "And yet, we are still alive."</p>
  
      <p>🐵 Wukong said nothing.<br>
      🐵 His fists clenched. His pride burned.</p>
  
      <p>But the Golden Headband had spoken.</p>
  
      <p>For the first time, his strength had been restrained.</p>
  
      <p>🔥 And he hated it.</p>
  
      <p>☀️ The road stretched on. The journey continued. But for Sun Wukong, the true battle had just begun.</p>
