      <h2>Setup â€“ The Gathering Storm</h2>
      <p><strong>Chapter 4: The Fall of the Thunder King</strong></p>
  
      <p>ðŸ”¥ Sangoâ€™s power is unmatched, but his rage is uncontrollable. With Ajakaâ€™s return and the chiefs turning against him, the mighty king stands on the edge of his own destruction. âš¡</p>
  
      <p>The sky over Oyo darkened, though the sun had not yet set. Heavy clouds swirled above the city, mirroring the unrest within the palace. Sango, once beloved, now sat alone, his golden crown feeling heavier than ever. The thunder that once answered his call now rumbled without his command.</p>
  
      <p>Word had spreadâ€”Ajaka had returned. The chiefs, the warriors, even some of Sangoâ€™s own council had welcomed him back. A challenge had been made.</p>
  
      <p>Oya, his fierce and devoted wife, stood beside him. Her voice was calm but firm.<br>
      "The people fear you, my king. Even the Orishas do not rule through fear alone."</p>
  
      <p>Sango scoffed, gripping his double-headed axe.<br>
      "Fear is power, Oya. If they fear me, they will obey."</p>
  
      <p>But even as he spoke, he could feel the storm slipping from his grasp.</p>

      <h2>Conflict & Action â€“ The Battle for Oyo</h2>
      <p><strong>The Battle for Oyo</strong></p>
  
      <p>The warriors loyal to Ajaka marched through the city gates. Their leader did not seek bloodshed, only to reclaim what was once his. But Sango would not yield so easily.</p>
  
      <p>Lightning crackled in the sky. The ground trembled as Sango raised his hands to the heavens. Bolts of fire and fury rained down upon the battlefield.</p>
  
      <p>But this time, something was different.</p>
  
      <p>The lightning did not strike only his enemiesâ€”it lashed out wildly, setting fire to his own city, his own palace.</p>
  
      <p>Oyo burned.</p>
  
      <p>The people screamed.</p>
  
      <p>Oya, her eyes filled with sorrow, called out to him.<br>
      "Sango! The flames are not your enemies, but your own undoing!"</p>
  
      <p>But Sango could not hear her. His rage had become a storm he could no longer control.</p>

      <h2>Resolution & Cliffhanger â€“ The Thunder Kingâ€™s Flight</h2>
      <p><strong>The Thunder Kingâ€™s Flight</strong></p>
  
      <p>As the flames devoured Oyo, Sango staggered back. His own powers had betrayed him. The thunder god, the warrior king, had destroyed the very people he swore to protect.</p>
  
      <p>He turned to Oya.<br>
      "Iâ€¦ I did not mean toâ€”"</p>
  
      <p>But there was no time.</p>
  
      <p>His enemies pushed forward, the city crumbled, and Sango did the unthinkable. He fled.</p>
  
      <p>Through the smoke and flames, he ran. The mighty warrior became a shadow in the night, disappearing into the forests beyond Oyo.</p>
  
      <p>The people whispered of his fall. Some claimed he had been struck down by the heavens, others that he had vanished into the rivers. But Oya, standing among the ruins of his empire, knew the truth.</p>
  
      <p>"Sango is not dead," she murmured. "But he is no longer a man."</p>
  
      <p>Far away, the sky rumbled with distant thunder.</p>
  
      <p>Sango had become something more than a king.</p>
